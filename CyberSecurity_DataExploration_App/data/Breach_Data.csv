Jason Smathers is charged with stealing his employer's subscriber list and selling it. 
NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - A software engineer at America Online was arrested Wednesday and charged with stealing AOL's subscriber list and selling it to someone sending spam e-mail, federal prosecutors in New York said.

According to the criminal complaint, Jason Smathers of Harpers Ferry, W. Va., used his inside knowledge of AOL's computer system to steal a list of 92 million AOL customer account ""screen names,"" and then sold them to Sean Dunaway, who is not an AOL employee.

Dunaway, of Las Vegas, NV., was accused of using the list to promote his own Internet gambling business and also sold the list to other spammers for $52,000, according to David Kelley, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

The complaint further charges that Dunaway later paid Smathers $100,000 for an updated version of AOL's customer list.

Megan Gaffney, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York, confirmed that both men appeared in court Wednesday.

Dunaway, 21, attended federal court in Las Vegas, and Smathers, 24, made his initial federal court appearance in Virginia. Smathers will be detained overnight until a detention hearing tomorrow, Gaffney said.

Defense lawyers could not be reached for comment.

The two men each face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to prosecutors.

An AOL spokesman said Smathers has been fired from the company.

""We deeply regret what has taken place and are thoroughly reviewing and strengthening our internal procedures as a result of this investigation and arrest,"" AOL said in a statement.

According to the complaint, Smathers used another employee's ID in April and May 2003 to assemble a complete list of AOL's customer account screen names, zip codes, telephone numbers and credit card types.

""(But) AOL has uncovered no information indicating that this theft involved member credit card or password information stored by AOL,"" said the statement from AOL.

Ameritrade Inc. has advised 200,000 current and former customers that a computer backup tape containing their personal information has been lost, MSNBC.com has learned. The tape contained information spanning the years 2000-2003, and included both current and past consumers of the online broker, according to spokeswoman Donna Kush.

Notices were mailed to the affected consumers last week, according to the company.

""We believe that information about your closed account resided on the missing tape,"" read one typical message, sent to a former Ameritrade customer. ""The information could include your account number, name and/or other personal information, like your Social Security number.""

The letter also says that the missing tape was ""likely lost or was destroyed.""

The online broker has over 3.7 million current customers, Kush said.

A total of four backup tapes  were found to be missing from a box that was damaged during shipping between two facilities, the company said. Three of the four tapes have been recovered at the shipper's facility.

""We don't believe any foul play was involved,"" Kush said.  ""And we are confident no customer accounts have been compromised or misused.""

Information on the tapes was compressed, so viewing it would require special equipment, Kush said. It was not encrypted, she added.

The incident was first discovered in February, according to Kush. The company wanted to wait until it could verify the impacted consumers before sending notification, she said.

News of the lost tape echoes a similar incident announced in February involving Bank of America , which lost a tape during shipping that included information on 1.2 million customers. Most were federal employees, and the tapes included information on high-profile government workers, including several U.S. Senators.

Several high-profile data theft incidents have splattered news pages since Feb. 14, when ChoicePoint Inc. announced criminals posing as clients downloaded personal information on 145,000 people.

""We sincerely apologize for this unusual event, and any discomfort it may cause you,"" the Ameritrade e-mail said. ""That's why we wanted to notify you as quickly as possible, and let you know what actions we are taking.""","financial","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"
"4","Citigroup","3,900,000","2005","Personal Data for 3.9 Million Lost in Transit
In one of the largest breaches of data security to date, CitiFinancial, the consumer finance subsidiary of Citigroup, announced yesterday that a box of computer tapes containing information on 3.9 million customers was lost by United Parcel Service last month, while in transit to a credit reporting agency.

Executives at Citigroup said the tapes were picked up by U.P.S. early in May and had not been seen since.

The tapes contained names, addresses, Social Security numbers, account numbers, payment histories and other details on small personal loans made to millions of customers through CitiFinancial's network of more than 1,800 lending branches, or through retailers whose product financing was handled by CitiFinancial's retail services division.

The company said there was no indication that the tapes had been stolen or that any of the data in them had been compromised.

It was, however, the latest in a series of recent data-security failures involving nearly every kind of institution that compiles personal information -- ranging from data brokers like ChoicePoint and LexisNexis to financial institutions like Bank of America and Wachovia to the media giant Time Warner to universities like Boston College and the University of California, Berkeley.

All these institutions have reported data breaches in the last five months, affecting millions of individuals and spurring Congressional hearings and numerous bills aimed at improving security in the handling of sensitive consumer information. The fear is that Social Security numbers, when combined with a consumer's name, address and date of birth, can be used by thieves to open new lines of credit, secure loans and otherwise steal someone's identity.

Whether the recently reported breaches indicate an epidemic of data loss is unclear. Many privacy and security advocates have suggested that a California law, requiring that consumers be notified of data security breaches, has led to more confessions of data losses and increased awareness of a longstanding problem.

""I think what we're seeing is a situation that's been going on for a long time,"" said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in San Diego, ""and one which has only been made visible by California's law.""

The California law, which went into effect in July 2003, requires state government agencies as well as companies and nonprofit organizations -- regardless of where in the country they do business -- to notify California customers if the personal information maintained in their data files has been compromised.

Yet in an age of transnational banks, Internet commerce and giant data aggregators, notifying only California residents when data on consumers all over the country is potentially lost or compromised has proved to be a public relations impossibility. (ChoicePoint was widely accused of planning to notify only California residents when it learned that information on at least 145,000 Americans had fallen into the hands of thieves; the company, however, said it was planning on nationwide notification all along.)

Now, with each week bringing new reports of data loss, whether because tapes fell off the back of a U.P.S. truck or because data was electronically stolen by hackers or thieves, at least five other states -- Arkansas, North Dakota, Georgia, Montana and Washington -- have passed similar notification laws. As of last month, dozens of other states were considering similar laws.

In the most recent incident, Citigroup executives say the box containing the tapes was handed over to U.P.S., along with other items for shipping, on May 2, under ""special security procedures"" that the bank required of the courier. One of those special procedures, said Citigroup's chief operations and technology officer, Debby Hopkins, included scanning the bar code on each package, rather than scanning only the single bar code on the shipment manifest, which is a summary document listing all the packages being moved in one shipment.

According to Ms. Hopkins, just the summary document was scanned for the box, which was picked up in Weehawken, N.J., so U.P.S. was unable to track where in the delivery chain the box was lost. It was not until May 20 that an employee of Experian, the credit reporting agency that was to receive the tapes, called CitiFinancial to report that they had not arrived at Experian's data-processing center in Allen, Tex. An investigation by U.P.S. failed to locate the package.

CitiFinancial has notified the Secret Service, which is called whenever there is a compromise of financial data. The agency is investigating the incident, and CitiFinancial has begun sending letters to all 3.9 million customers advising them of the loss and offering them 90 days of free enrollment in a credit-monitoring service. Other institutions with data-loss problems have also offered free credit-monitoring services, some for as long as a year.

A spokesman for U.P.S., Norman Black, would not go into specifics on where or how the security system broke down, but said the courier was continuing its investigation. Mr. Black said blame ultimately lay with his company.

""They tendered us a package and expected it to be delivered in the reliable way that we always do,"" he said, ""and we had to go back to them and tell them that we can't find it.""

Mr. Black said that an exhaustive search of all U.P.S. facilities nationwide had turned up no sign of the package. ""It's rare that it gets to the point where we can find no trace of it,"" he said.

A spokesman for Experian, Donald A. Girard, said he had never seen an instance of a shipment of this kind simply disappearing, although he added that he and other credit agencies had been encouraging financial institutions to convert from tapes to encrypted electronic delivery of data.

""Experian has been actively working for quite a while with all major data contributors to convert to electronic data transference,"" Mr. Girard said, ""to mitigate risk in this process.""

Ms. Hopkins of Citigroup said that most of the company's divisions already did this, and that the CitiFinancial unit is scheduled to convert to such electronic transfers in July.

She also said that the missing tapes, which were not encrypted, were created using mainframe-type computers and highly specialized hardware and software that would make it difficult -- though not impossible -- to extract data from them.

And Ms. Givens of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse said, ""Your everyday dumpster diver may not know what to do with these tapes, but if these tapes ever find their way into the hands of an international crime ring, I think they'll figure it out.""","financial","3",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

CardSystems Solutions – the credit-card processing company that recently exposed 40 million debit and credit-card accounts in a cyber break-in – failed to secure its network, even though the network had been certified secure to a data security standard, according to Visa.

Since 2001, Visa and MasterCard have been touting a data security industry standard they developed in an effort to prevent credit-card data theft and stave off federal regulation. The standard has become a required criteria for businesses handling credit-card transactions.

Visa spokeswoman Rosetta Jones told Wired News that CardSystems Solutions received certification in June 2004 that it was compliant with the standard, but an assessment after the breach showed it was not compliant.

MasterCard International announced last Friday that intruders had accessed the data from CardSystems Solutions, a payment processing company based in Arizona, after placing a malicious script on the company's network.

""Had they been following the rules and requirements, they would not have been compromised,"" Jones said.

CardSystems did not return calls for comment.

The company was due this month for an annual audit to determine its ongoing compliance with the standard when it discovered the data breach in May.

""We sent in a forensic team (after the breach) and determined they were not compliant based on how they were managing data,"" Jones said.

Jones would not provide specifics on what auditors found in their assessment. But when asked if it would be fair to say that the evidence indicated a failure to apply a firewall or maintain virus definitions – two basic steps in securing a network – she said, ""That would be fair.""

The standard, called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI, consists of 12 requirements (PDF), such as installing a firewall and anti-virus software and regularly updating virus definitions. It also requires companies to encrypt data, to restrict data access to people who need it and to assign a unique identifying number to people with access rights in order to monitor who views and downloads data.

Although the standard was developed by Visa and MasterCard, it's endorsed by other credit-card companies. It applies to any merchant or service provider that processes, transmits or stores credit-card payments and places additional requirements on card issuers, such as banks, to ensure that merchants and service providers comply with the requirements and report breaches in a timely manner. The standard went into effect June 2001, although businesses had until June 30th of this year to validate that they were in compliance, Jones said.

Since 2001, any business wishing to process credit-card transactions had to sign a contract binding them to the PCI standard and obtain a security audit from an approved assessor certifying their compliance.

Jones said CardSystems had an assessor evaluate its compliance and submitted paperwork toward that compliance in June 2003. But Visa rejected it.

""We felt that they had more work to do to become more fully compliant,"" Jones said, declining to disclose what prompted the rejection. A year later CardSystems submitted paperwork again and received certification in June 2004.

Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer at Counterpane, a computer security firm that helps companies secure and monitor their networks, said the revelation highlights a universal problem with enforcing standards.

""The standard not only has to be good, but the compliance process has to have integrity,"" Schneier said. ""But a lot of (compliance involves) self-certification. It's things you say you do. And it's only audited minimally.""

CardSystems is a major processor of credit-card transactions. According to its website, it processes more than $15 billion annually in credit-card transactions for Visa, American Express, MasterCard and Discover. It also processes online transactions and Electronic Benefit Transfer transactions – cards used by the government to dole out social welfare benefits such as food stamps and unemployment payments.

Jones wouldn't say who performed the compliance assessment for CardSystems, but she noted that the assessor had to come from an approved list of auditors (PDF) that Visa and MasterCard maintains.

Approved assessors go through a screening process. Jones said their reputation relies on making certain that they ""assess (a company's) situation as truthfully and honestly as possible.""

Per the PCI standard agreement, Visa and MasterCard can fine merchants that don't comply with the data standard or they can withdraw the company's right to accept credit-card payments or process transactions. They could also conceivably collect damages from a company if the breach resulted in a massive data loss that required Visa or MasterCard to launch an expensive public relations campaign to counteract the loss of public confidence in their cards.

""Visa and MasterCard could say… 'you owe us $300,000 that we had to spend on attorneys' fees and PR consultants,'"" said Chad King, a partner in the Texas law firm Hughes and Luce, who specializes in privacy and data security issues. ""Now would they do that? It's unlikely. But if the merchant is Amazon.com, then maybe Visa would do it.""

The bank that issued the credit card and the merchant's bank could also be fined up to $500,000 per incident if a merchant or service provider they did business with was out of compliance with the standard at the time of a breach. Card issuers would also be subject to a $100,000 penalty if they failed to notify Visa's fraud control unit of a suspected or confirmed loss of data at one of their merchants or service providers.

King said that many large merchants are already complying with the standards.

""This is going to help smaller merchants and processors,"" he said. ""It will make them sit up and take note: If you're going to play in the credit-card game, here are the rules.""

The compliance requirement for the data standard goes into effect as federal lawmakers are discussing legislation to regulate businesses that deal with sensitive personal information in the wake of other high-profile data breaches and security failures at companies like ChoicePoint, Bank of America and CitiBank.

""They are really trying to hold up a banner and say we're self-regulating and we can do this ourselves,"" King said. ""But I think ultimately we will see some federal regulation here.""

Schneier said the PCI standard has teeth, since it levies financial penalties and raises the cost of processing credit cards for companies that are caught not complying, but he said Visa and MasterCard now have to work out the compliance issues.

""They're terrified that everybody will be afraid to use their credit card,"" Schneier said, about the motivation for the standard requirements. ""They're trying to protect the integrity of their brands. So if they're not working, Visa and MasterCard will figure out how to make them work.""

Of course the standard will motivate companies only if they actually have to pay a price for non-compliance. Jones said that there is currently no plan to fine CardSystems Solutions for its lax security.

Further Update: Sometime after 7 pm the download link went down as well, but there is at least one mirror site. AOL is in damage control mode – the fact that they took the data down shows that someone there had the sense to realize how destructive this was, but it is also an admission of wrongdoing of sorts. Either way, the data is now out there for anyone that wants to use (or abuse) it.

Update: Sometime around 7 pm PST on Sunday, the AOL site referred to below was taken down. The direct link to the data is still live. A cached copy of the page is here.

AOL must have missed the uproar over the DOJ’s demand for “anonymized” search data last year that caused all sorts of pain for Microsoft and Google. That’s the only way to explain their release of data that includes 20 million web queries from 650,000 AOL users.

The data includes all searches from those users for a three month period this year, as well as whether they clicked on a result, what that result was and where it appeared on the result page. It’s a 439 MB compressed download, expanded to just over 2 gigs. The data is available here (this link is directly to the file) and the output is in ten text files, tab delineated.

The utter stupidity of this is staggering. AOL  has released very private data about its users without their permission. While the AOL username has been changed to a random ID number, the abilitiy to analyze all searches by a single user will often lead people to easily determine who the user is, and what they are up to. The data includes personal names, addresses, social security numbers and everything else someone might type into a search box.

The most serious problem is the fact that many people often search on their own name, or those of their friends and family, to see what information is available about them on the net. Combine these ego searches with porn queries and you have a serious embarrassment. Combine them with “buy ecstasy” and you have evidence of a crime. Combine it with an address, social security number, etc., and you have an identity theft waiting to happen. The possibilities are endless.

Marketers are going nuts over the possibilities, users are calling for a boycott of AOL, and others are just enraged:

User 491577 searches for “florida cna pca lakeland tampa”, “emt school training florida”, “low calorie meals”, “infant seat”, and “fisher price roller blades”. Among user 39509’s hundreds of searches are: “ford 352”, “oklahoma disciplined pastors”, “oklahoma disciplined doctors”, “home loans”, and some other personally identifying and illegal stuff I’m going to leave out of here. Among user 545605’s searches are “shore hills park mays landing nj”, “frank william sindoni md”, “ceramic ashtrays”, “transfer money to china”, and “capital gains on sale of house”. Compared to some of the data, these examples are on the safe side. I’m leaving out the worst of it – searches for names of specific people, addresses, telephone numbers, illegal drugs, and more. There is no question that law enforcement, employers, or friends could figure out who some of these people are.

There is some really scary stuff in this data.

I am assuming that AOL will take this page and the data down soon, but as of the time of this post it has been downloaded 809 times already. People I’ve spoken with are already building a web interface to the data. If you are an AOL customer, I feel sorry for you.

Note that Microsoft has proposed releasing similar data to researchers, although with an important difference – the data is not associated with a user. Excite released data very similar to what AOL has done here, with user associations, in 1999.

AOL is hitting bottom when it comes to brand image. This story comes on the heels of the recorded phone call with customer service disaster as well as a just-in story about a woman who is unable to cancel her deceased father’s AOL account, nine months after his death.","tech","1",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Intentional_Data_Leak"
"7","US Dept of Vet Affairs","26,500,000","2006","VA settlement demonstrates just how costly lax security can be
If you want another good reason to make sure your sensitive data is adequately locked down, look no farther than the Veterans Affairs Department, which last week agreed to pay $20 million to settle a class action lawsuit over the 2006 loss of a laptop containing records with personal information about up to 26.5 million veterans and active duty personnel.

That’s a lot of money, and it will be paid from taxpayers’ dollars, but VA got off lucky. The suit originally asked for $1,000 for each person whose data was exposed, which could have been more than $26 billion. That’s nearly enough to bail out a good-sized bank.

The settlement demonstrates that the repercussions of exposing data can be long-lasting and that the cost can go far beyond the immediate expense of cleaning up the breach. For companies it has long been known that negative publicity resulting from public notification of a data breach can quickly translate into millions of dollars of lost shareholder value as stock prices tumble. Agencies do not have to worry about stock prices, but the threat of other costs is real. The VA agreed to the settlement even though the department has said there is no evidence that the information on the stolen laptop was used or than any person involved was harmed by it.

Lesson: It could be a lot cheaper to secure your data in the first place than to pay for damage control later.

To its credit, the VA generally has responded well to this incident despite an initial three-week delay after the theft was reported before possible victims were alerted back. Since then the department has gotten serious about improving protections on data and has been a major user of Microsoft’s Rights Management Services, which places controls on the use of documents. Security still is not perfect, but it is a huge department with hundreds of facilities and offices located around the country offering a multitude of services, so it is gong to take a long time to get everything under control. But the department did the right thing in stepping up and taking responsibility for the huge 2006 loss and agreeing to the payout, even if it does hurt the taxpayers.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington by five veterans groups in June 2006, a month after news was released of the theft of a laptop on which a VA data analyst had loaded the data. The laptop was recovered with the data apparently intact. But it is impossible say with absolute certainty that the data was not accessed and copied. Millions of persons whose names, birthdates and Social Security numbers were in the data were put to the trouble of monitoring their credit and worrying about data theft.

The settlement calls for payments of from $75 to $1,500 to persons who can show some harm resulting from the incident, which could include physical symptoms of stress or expenses for credit monitoring. Any money left over from the $20 million fund will be donated to veterans’ charities.

Let’s hope that few of the veterans whose data was exposed in the incident were badly harmed by it and that actual payouts of damages will be small. The upside of the incident could prove to be twofold: A sizeable chunk of money could go to deserving charities, and a lesson will have been learned about the value of preventing a breach rather than responding to it after the fact.","government","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

Police investigate as info on 4M goes missing
Personal data on almost 4 million customers of Japanese telecom carrier KDDI Corp. has been breached, the company said Tuesday.

The data includes the name, address and telephone number of 3,996,789 people who had applied for accounts with KDDI's Dion Internet provider service up to Dec. 18, 2003, KDDI said. Additionally the gender, birthday and e-mail addresses of some of the people was also leaked.

KDDI is Japan's second-largest telecommunications carrier. It operates fixed-line, dial-up Internet, broadband and cellular services through a number of different companies.

The carrier became aware of the leak on May 31 this year when it received a phone call from someone claiming to possess a CD-ROM of the data, said Yoko Watanabe, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based carrier. The original source of the data has yet to be determined and Watanabe declined to comment on other aspects of the case, which is being investigated by the police, she said.

The leak is just the latest of several to hit the headlines in Japan this year. Personal information has been leaked by companies a number of times onto the Internet through viruses that infect PCs running file sharing programs. While the source of the data lost by KDDI is not yet clear, the episode is likely to increase fears of identity theft and other fraud in Japan.

In recent years the number of frauds committed against consumers using such information has been on the rise. Armed with the name and address or telephone number of a consumer, fraudsters can send out bills or make calls demanding payment for services that were never delivered. The slick frauds often dupe consumers into sending money before they realize they have been tricked.","telecoms","1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

US job website Monster.com has suffered an online attack with the personal data of hundreds of thousands of users stolen, says a security firm.
A computer program was used to access the employers' section of the website using stolen log-in credentials.

Symantec said the log-ins were used to harvest user names, e-mail addresses, home addresses and phone numbers, which were uploaded to a remote web server.

The stolen data could be used to send phishing and spam e-mails.
""This remote server held over 1.6 million entries with personal information belonging to several hundred thousands of candidates, mainly based in the US, who had posted their resumes to the Monster.com website,"" reported Symantec.

Security breach

The firm has contacted Monster.com to inform them of the security breach.

Symantec said it had seen reports of phishing e-mails sent out to Monster.com users which were ""very realistic"" and contained ""personal information of the victims"".

The e-mail encouraged users to download a Monster Job Seeker Tool, which was in fact a program that encrypted files in their computer and left a ransom note demanding money for their decryption.

""To the best of our knowledge, this is not a hack of Monster's security, rather, legitimate customer credentials are being used to log in to the database,"" said Patrick Manzo, vice president of compliance and fraud prevention at Monster.

He added: ""There have been reports of this as an issue of identify theft.

""We are not aware of any cases of identity theft. In fact, the information that is gathered from Monster is no different than that displayed in a phone book.""

The program used to access Monster.com user data was a Trojan, which are commonly used to gain access to bank details, usernames and passwords.

More than 8,000 new variants of Trojans are found each month, according to internet security specialists Sophos.

Last year, a British nurse was blackmailed by hackers who had used a Trojan to access her personal e-mails.

They threatened to reveal personal details unless she paid them.

Symantec said users should always limit contact information posted to job websites and to use a disposable e-mail address.

The details of three million candidates for the driving theory test have gone missing, Ruth Kelly has told MPs.
Names, addresses and phone numbers - but no financial information - were among details on a computer hard drive which went missing in the US in May.

It belonged to a contractor working for the Driving Standards Agency, she said.

It is the second time in a month ministers have apologised for a loss of data after HM Revenue and Customs lost discs containing 25m people's details.
Ms Kelly said the details of learner drivers had been formatted specifically to meet the security requirements of the private contractor, Pearson Driving Assessments Ltd, and were not ""readily usable or accessible"" by third parties.

Risks 'not substantial'

She said the details were not sent in the post - but the hard drive had not been found where it had been expected to be, in a ""secure facility"" in Iowa.

The information commission had judged the risks presented by the loss were not ""substantial"" and there was no need to notify each person individually.

The details did not include bank account details, National Insurance numbers, driving licence numbers or dates of birth, she said.

""Nevertheless I apologise for any uncertainty or concern that these individuals may experience,"" Ms Kelly said.

She added the Driving Standards Agency had set up a dedicated advice line for candidates who took their driving theory test between September 2004 and April 2007.

Ms Kelly said the loss had emerged as part of a Department of Transport audit, as part of a review of data security across government departments.

'Systemic failure'

It appears a junior minister, Stephen Ladyman, was informed about the problem in June and agreed a series of procedures and wide audit with Pearson - but did not make the information public.

Details of candidates were sent electronically to Pearson Driving Assessments in Iowa. The hard drive was then sent to another state before being brought back to Iowa, where it went missing.

Ms Kelly said the Department of Transport was making changes to the way it handled data - including more electronic transfer and ""secure couriers"" for that information which could not be transmitted that way, as well as increased emphasis on the Data Protection Act.

It follows the loss of personal details of more than 6,000 drivers by the Driver and Vehicle Agency in Coleraine, Northern Ireland in November.

Ms Kelly said that agency would be merged with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea to reduce the risk of it happening again.

And in October, the prime minister had to apologise for the loss of two discs containing the entire child benefit database - personal details of 25 million people including National Insurance numbers and bank accounts.

'Spy-in-the-sky'

Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers said it was further evidence of a lack of competence and ""systemic failure"" by the government in handling private data.

""Quite simply the government is failing in its duty to obey its own laws on data protection,"" she said.
Ms Villiers told Ms Kelly: ""This incident and the HM Revenue and Customs disaster are another blow to your plans for an untested spy-in-the-sky national road pricing scheme.""

Susan Kramer, for the Liberal Democrats described the further loss of data from another government department as ""mind-bending"".

She said: ""Perhaps the answer is we should be holding less data on people or it should automatically be destroyed.

""I still can't get to the bottom of how old some of this data was on people who'd applied for drivers' licences.

""This constant attempt to gather data, to get more data, to know more about you, to link it more together, all of that it seems to me is what comes into question.""

'Deep regret'

Pearson plc, the parent company of Pearson Driving Assessments Ltd, said: ""We take great care over the quality and security of our data and we deeply regret this incident.

""There is no loss of sensitive financial data and no evidence of misuse. We have put in place additional measures to strengthen data security further.""

The BBC's Justin Webb said the company had reported the missing hard drive to Iowa police, but referred to it has having been ""mislaid"" and said there was no evidence it had been stolen.

Ms Kelly's statement followed Chancellor Alistair Darling's presentation of an interim report by Kieran Poynter, UK chairman at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, into the loss of the two child benefit discs.","government","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

A senior database administrator at a subsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services who was responsible for defining and enforcing data access rights at the firm took data belonging to as many as 8.5 million consumers -- not 2.3 million, as originally disclosed by the company.

The new number was disclosed Wednesday in filings by Fidelity National with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company warned of the possibility that even more data may have been compromised in the breach. Fidelity National, which is not connected with the more widely known mutual funds company Fidelity Investments, is a transaction processing and outsourcing services provider to the financial industry. It is based in Jacksonville, Fla.

On July 3, Fidelity National disclosed that a database administrator, who is no longer with the company, had illegally downloaded and sold customer data to a data broker. The data broker, in turn, sold a subset of the data to other direct marketing companies. The stolen data included names, addresses, birth dates, bank account and credit card information, the company said.

The database administrator worked for Certegy, which provides a check-authorization service to help merchants decide whether to accept checks as payment for goods and service.

In its SEC filing, Fidelity National said that an investigation into the theft by the employee showed that 8.5 million records were stolen. Of that number, about 5.7 million records were checking account records and about 1.5 million records included credit card details. The remaining records contained only identifying information such as names, addresses, dates of birth and telephone numbers.

""This is an incremental increase of approximately 3.5 million checking account records and approximately 1.4 million credit card records over our announcement on July 3, 2007,"" Fidelity National said in its statement. Fidelity added that a portion of the stolen data was taken from the company's credit card issuance business.

Fidelity said it ""continues to see no evidence of the stolen information being used for anything other than marketing purposes. Although the company does not anticipate significant liability to consumers or for financial fraud, there can be no assurance that this matter will not result in fines or other consequences that adversely impact the Company or its relationship with governing organizations, customers or regulators.""","financial","3",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Intentional_Data_Leak"
"13","City and Hackney Teaching Primary Care Trust","160,000","2007","Losing trust in the Trusts - and the dangers of being driven to abstraction
Well, I’d been hoping for a quiet Christmas away from the PC, but it was not to be… News broke today, Sunday, of yet more public sector data breaches. And once again it’s the Department of Health which is facing a diagnosis of poor security process.

Only a couple of days ago John-Paul Kamath reported on the Information Commissioner’s Office ruling that the DoH had breached the data protection act, by failing to properly protect personal details entered into the Medical Training Application Service website. Now it’s the patients’ data that the DoH has confessed hasn’t been getting quite the treatment it deserves.


Losing trust in the Trusts

The BBC has reported that nine NHS trusts have lost patient data, with up to 168,000 people affected. The reported incidents include the loss of a disc containing the names and addresses of 160,000 children, which failed to arrive at the hospital to which it was being sent by City and Hackney Primary Care Trust. According to the Times, the losses were uncovered during a data security review.

The Department of Health has said that affected patients have been informed – and certainly I know a couple of individuals in my local area who’ve already received letters from Sutton and Merton, one of the trusts that has confessed to a breach. It’s good to know that they are at least confessing to the problems and attempting to address them, but it’s still worrying. Especially if my fellow blogger David Lacey is right, and the situation is much worse than the public realises!

As in the high-profile HMRC case, this latest public sector confession once again concerns the physical, accidental loss of media – data sticks, discs, laptops… As Stuart King has previously noted in his blog on the 2007 data breach survey, it’s this kind of accidental loss that is actually the most frequent cause of data breaches.

The dangers of abstraction

Perhaps it’s not that surprising. For one thing, with the ability to store and transport such large amounts of data about so many individuals in one relatively small, single object, it’s certainly far easier to lose far more in one go than would have been possible even ten years ago.

But I wonder whether the abstraction of the data doesn’t also help to raise the risk.

A USB stick containing the personal medical records of 160,000 people or a commercially sensitive presentation looks the same as one holding a few holiday snaps – or nothing at all. I suspect it’s easier to get a little careless about something that seems, on the face of it, anonymous and replaceable, than it would be with say, paper records, x-ray films, or a diary. Even though there is no doubt that just as much (if not more) real world damage could be done to the individuals concerned should the data fall into the wrong hands.

I can still remember earning some holiday cash boxing records for the clinic at my father’s GP surgery as a teenager, in the pre-computerisation days of the NHS. The paper records were held in big brown cardboard files with just the name, data of birth, and address visible on the outside. I was far too much of a good girl to sneak a peak inside, but nevertheless you could gather a sense of each individual’s life from the state of their records. The blue and red printed covers told you clearly that this was a man or woman, and the chunkiness of the records relative to the person’s age gave you a pretty clear idea of their general state of health. Babies had crisp, flat folders, almost empty, every bit as new to the world as they were. Older people might have numerous folders, some of them yellowing and softened so much that the edges of the card almost turned to dust in your hands. My own, following a number of operations as a child, was pretty chunky itself! (And, okay, I did read that one…)

Perhaps I’m a little too given to sentiment, but the physical presence of those files in my hands always used to impress me with the sense of those real lives to which they related. And as a result, I took great care when I went about my work there. Would I have been quite so careful if all I’d had to do was drag and drop a few records about on screen? Sadly, I’m not so sure…","government","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

An unnamed contractor is being blamed for a data breach at Gap Inc. that has compromised the data of about 800,000 people who applied for jobs with the U.S. clothing retailer.

On Friday, Gap said the data had been stored on two laptop computers that were stolen from the vendor's offices. Although the job applicant information on the laptop -- which included Social Security numbers -- was supposed to be encrypted, it was not.

Gap's online job site is run by Taleo Corp., but on Friday Taleo said that it wasn't responsible for the breach. ""The data loss involved a Gap vendor that processes job applicant data. Taleo was not the vendor involved in this data loss,"" the company said in a statement.

Gap learned of the theft on Sept. 19, the company said in a letter sent to those affected.

Still, ""the company has no reason to believe the data contained on the computer was the target of the theft or that the personal information had been accessed or used improperly,"" Gap said in a statement.

The laptop had information on people who applied for positions at Gap stores, including Banana Republic and Old Navy, between July 2006 and June 2007. Gap has set up a Web site to assist those who may have been affected by the breach. Victims are being offered one year of credit monitoring and fraud resolution assistance.

Information on more than 165 million U.S. residents has been compromised since early 2005, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a privacy advocacy group.

If you're an organ donor, a welfare recipient, a student, an employee, a patient or if you do business or have an account virtually anywhere, your personal data is entrusted in the hands of strangers. These strangers have an obligation to keep information such as your date of birth, full name, address, Social Security number, phone numbers, medical records, employee records and banking information safe and confidential. However, through weak security on computer networks, theft and loss of laptops and employee negligence, much of your information can be exposed or fall into the hands of identity thieves through data breaches. Here are 15 of the largest data breaches in history in chronological order. If you have never been affected by a data breach, congratulations, you have been lucky so far as more than 340,102,273 records containing sensitive personal information have been breached just in the U.S. since January 2005.

Citigroup Loses Data of 3.9 Million Customers
On June 6, 2005, Citigroup announced that tapes containing personal data of 3.9 million consumer lending customers of its CitiFinancial subsidiary had been lost by UPS. Approximately 50,000 of the records belonged to customers who had closed their accounts, with the rest being active consumer accounts. The tapes were being shipped to a credit bureau in Texas when they were lost by UPS. The Social Security numbers, names, account history and loan information of the former and current customers. UPS claimed there seemed to be no indication of theft or fraudulent activity and Citigroup informed customers that there was ""little risk"" of accounts being compromised. The data was never recovered.

40 Million Visa, Mastercard and American Express Records Hacked
On June 19, 2005, CardSystems Solutions announced that 40 million debit and credit card numbers had been compromised in a successful hacking attempt using a malicious script. According to Visa, the network that was hacked had been certified secure based on an industry standard developed by none other than Mastercard and Visa. An investigation following the massive data breach revealed that the network was not compliant with the self-developed industry standards of security. Visa spokesperson Rosetta Jones threw CardSystems Solutions under the bus by saying, ""Had they been following the rules and requirements, they would not have been compromised.""

26.5 Million Records Stolen From US Dept of Veteran Affairs
In May 2006, an employee of the US Department of Veteran Affairs took a laptop home without authorization from the department. The laptop and the sensitive personal data of 26.5 million people who were discharged from the US military since 1975 it contained, were stolen during a burglary at the employee's home. Included in the data was veterans' names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth. In some cases, the same information was included for the veterans' wives. The department vowed to send a letter to every veteran affected in the breach ""to the extent possible.""

AOL Posts 20 Million User Searches
AOL inadvertently made public 20 million keyword searches made by hundreds of thousands of its users between March and May of 2006. On August 7, 2006, the company issued an apology, saying it was a mistake and no personally identifiable information had been made available. However, Michael Arrington, the editor of TechCrunch, reviewed the data and found that it contained credit card numbers, Social Security card numbers, names and addresses. All of the exposed data was that of AOL users in the U.S.

Unauthorized Intrusion at TJX Companies Inc. Exposes Over 100 Million Records
TJX Companies Inc. owns and operates TJMaxx, Marshalls, Winners, HomeSense, AJWright, TKMAxx and other off-retail outlets in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada and Puerto Rico. On Jan 17, 2007 TJX announced it had experienced an ""unauthorized intrusion"" into its computer systems. Initially the company claimed the security breach took place from May 2006 to January 2007. It later conceded that the system was also likely hacked multiple times beginning in July 2005. TJX had used an outdated wireless security encryption system and had failed to install firewalls and data encryption, so the theives were easily able to access streaming personal data as it was scanned. A month before the breach was discovered, information stolen from TJX was used in an $8 million gift card scam. As the story of this historically huge data breach unfolded, the numbers continued to grow. All told, it is believed that more than 100 million records including private and sensitive data were stolen in the breach. The ringleader of the theft operation was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $600,000 in restitution.

8.6 Million Records Stolen From Dai Nippon Printing Company
A former contractor of Dai Nippon Printing Company in Tokyo, Japan stole 8.6 million records containing the personal data of customers of 43 of the company's clients. The company announced this data breach on March 12, 2007. The stolen data included the names, addresses and credit card numbers of people who were targeted for direct marketing. In the US, customers of American Home Assurance Co. and Toyota Motor were affected in the breach.

8.5 Million Records Stolen From Fidelity National Information Services
On July 3, 2007 an employee at Certegy Check Services, a subsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services, stole 8.5 million customer records, which included credit card and banking information and other personal information. A class action lawsuit was filed against Fidelity and one of its subsidiaries, charging the companies with negligence in connection with the data breach. The employee, a former database analyst at Certegy Check Services Inc. agreed to plead guilty to federal fraud charges and was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison and ordered to pay a $3.2 million fine. On July 7, 2008, a class action settlement entitled each person whose financial information was stolen to up to $20,000 for unreimbursed identity theft losses.

6.3 Million Data Files Stolen From TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
When one of TD Ameritrade's databases was hacked in 2007, the thief was able to gain access to more than 6.3 million customer data files. The company announced that the data stolen included names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home addresses but no Social Security numbers. Those affected by this data breach began receiving e-mail spam shortly after the theft and on September 14, 2007 Ameritrade sent a mass e-mail to customers conceding that Social Security numbers had been accessed in the breach. On October 27, 2009, TD Ameritrade seemed to be close to a settlement with those affected by the data theft. However, the federal judge overseeing the case rejected the proposed settlement, saying it provided ""no discernible benefit to the victims,"" so it's back to the drawing board for Ameritrade to try to come up with a new offer that won't insult the victims or the court.

25 Million Child Benefit Records Missing From HM Revenue and Customs
In the UK, two password-protected CDs containing the names, birth dates and National Insurance numbers of 25 million children, parents, guardians and caregivers contained in the HM Revenue and Customs child benefit database were lost on October 18, 2007. However, the missing CDs were not reported to the senior management at HM Revenue and Customs until November 8, 2007. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling was notified of the loss on November 10, 2007 and the public was notified on November 22, 2007. Darling said the reason for the delay in notifying those who may be affected was necessary to allow the banks time to locate any potentially affected accounts and monitor them for unusual activity.

40 Million Credit Card Records Stolen From Hannaford Brothers Supermarkets
In March 2008, Hannaford Brothers supermarket chain disclosed it had suffered a data breach involving credit and debit card transactions at its stores. Malware was loaded onto the Hannaford servers and allowed hackers to intercept the card data as customers swiped them at checkout counters. The 40 million stolen credit card numbers and expiration dates were transferred overseas and resulted in at least 2,000 cases of credit card fraud.

Data of 11 Million GS Caltex Customers Leaked
The personal data of 11.1 million GS Caltex customers was found on two discs that were discovered lying in the street in September 2008. GS Caltex is one of the country's largest oil refineries. The DVD and CD that were found were believed to have been thrown in the trash and contained the names, Social Security numbers, addresses, cell phone numbers, e-mail addresses and workplaces of customers. GS Caltex announced there had been no trace of any hacking and the data stored on the discs could not be used to make any purchases. Identity theft is perhaps another story.

5 Million Customer Records Compromised at CheckFree Corp.
 A data breach involving approximately 5 million customer records occurred when hackers took control of several Internet domains owned by CheckFree Corp. Malicious software installed on the server redirected traffic to a site hosted in the Ukraine. Since the company actually lost control of their domains, the actual size of the breach remains a mystery, but all 5 million consumers were notified in January 2009.

134 Million Records Compromised by Heartland Payment Systems
On Jan 20, 2009, New Jersey-based credit and debit processing and check management services Heartland Payment Systems announced that 134 million credit card records had been compromised as a result of a global fraud operation. Computer forensics analysis found that the Heartland network was infected with several instances of malicious software and cardholder data, including names and credit card numbers were stolen. The company says it is not taking more precautions to prevent data breaches in the future. Two Russian men and one Florida man were charged with the hacking of Hannaford Brothers Supermarkets and Heartland Payment Systems.

76 Million US Military Veterans' Records Compromised
The Inspector General of the National Archives and Records Administration is currently investigating a huge data breach involving millions of US veterans. The agency sent a defective hard drive back to a vendor for repair and recycling, but failed to destroy the data on the hard drive before sending. The defective drive was one of six drives in a RAID array containing an Oracle database that holds the personal data of 76 million veterans. The data on the drive potentially contains Social Security numbers of veterans dating back to 1972.

The biggest loss of credit-card data in history was brought about largely because of lax wireless LAN security, it has emerged
Hackers who stole 45 million customer records from the parent company of TK Maxx did so by breaking into the retail company's wireless LAN , it emerged on Monday.

TK Maxx's parent company, TJX, had secured its wireless network using Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) — one of the weakest forms of security for wireless LANs. Hackers broke in and stole the records — which included millions of credit card numbers — in the second half of 2005 and throughout 2006.

According to The Wall Street Journal, hackers cracked the WEP encryption protocol used to transmit data between price-checking devices, cash registers and computers at a store in Minnesota. The intruders then collected information submitted by employees logging on to the company's central database in Massachusetts, stealing usernames and passwords.

With that information, the hackers set up their own accounts on TJX's system. Over the 18-month period, their software collected transaction data, including credit-card numbers, into approximately 100 large files. Transaction data sent to banks, which was unencrypted by TJX, is also believed to have been intercepted by the hackers. According to The Wall Street Journal, the attackers even left encrypted messages on the TJX network to tell each other which files had been copied.

A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing in March revealed that TJX believed the attackers had stolen information from its computer systems in Watford that process and store payment card transactions for TK Maxx.

TJX also believed data had been stolen from the part of its computer systems in Massachusetts that processes and stores information related to payment card, cheque and unreceipted merchandise-return transactions for US and Puerto Rico customers at a number of its stores. Analysts have estimated the breach will cost the company approximately $1bn (£500m), excluding any litigation costs.

Many security experts have criticised the strength of WEP encryption. WEP was initially cracked in 2001, and most recently broken by German researchers last month, who beat the encryption using an ordinary laptop in under three seconds.

Financial services firm J.P. Morgan Chase is investigating claims by a Washington D.C.-based workers union that it dumped documents containing personal financial data belonging to its customers in garbage bags outside five branch offices in New York.

Separately, it is also sending out letters to tens of thousands of Chicago-area customers and some employees about the potential compromise of their account information after a tape containing the data was reported missing.

The Service Employees International Union, an organization claiming over 1.8 million members countrywide, has posted a video on YouTube that supposedly shows documents containing account data -- including full customer names, addresses and Social Security numbers -- being discovered in trash bags outside the bank branches in and around New York city.

Among the documents the video purports to show being recovered from the garbage bags are a loan application with the borrower's name, address and Social Security number, a checking account profile with similar details, a partially ripped account summary with personal data and a business credit application. The video ends with a message urging viewers to call Tom Kelly, the bank's head of media relations for Retail Financial Services and the U.S. Region.

JP Morgan and SEIU are currently locked in a labor dispute involving the hiring of security guards.

Kelly said that Chase is investigating the claims made by the SEIU in the YouTube video. According to Kelly, the standard procedure for disposing of financial documents at Chase branch locations is to put them into a large padlocked bin with an opening on top for inserting the documents. The papers are then later recovered from the bins and shredded. He added that the bins are not placed outside the facility.

""We don't know what happened here, we are trying to find out,"" he said. ""We had a conference call with all of our branch managers and reiterated what our policies and procedures are"" for document disposal.

The bank has also contacted SEIU's attorney and asked the group to share the customer information it claims to have recovered from the branch locations, Kelly said. ""If those customers are at risk, we want to contact them,"" he said, adding that so far the bank has not heard back from the SEIU. ""It is not clear that customer privacy was their first priority in this.""

A spokeswoman from the SEIU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, in a separate incident the bank two weeks ago started alerting some 47,000 customers and employees in the Chicago area about the potential compromise of their personal data after a disk containing the data was reported missing late last year.

The tape contained data from J.P. Morgan's private-client services business, which provides financial services to clients with a net worth in excess of US$1 million. According to Kelly, the tape was delivered to a secure off-site facility for storage but went missing after that. There is no evidence so far that the data has been misused, he said.

JP Morgan is offering a year's worth of credit monitoring services to affected clients. He also said that the bank took so long to inform affected individuals of the potential compromise because it needed to reconstruct the information contained on the tape.","financial","3",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has lost computer disks containing confidential details of 25 million child benefit recipients.
The organisation says it does not believe the records - names, addresses, dates of birth and bank accounts - have fallen into the wrong hands. This is not the first time it has lost sensitive information.

More than 15,000 Standard Life customers were put at risk of fraud after a courier lost a computer disk containing personal information.

The data was on a computer disk sent from the HMRC National Insurance contributions office in Newcastle to the insurer's headquarters in Edinburgh.

But the disk containing names, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and pension data never arrived.

HMRC routinely sends computer disks containing personal data on taxpayers to the insurance companies that hold their pensions.
A laptop computer holding sensitive information was stolen from the boot of a car belonging to an HRMC worker, putting hundreds of people at risk of fraud.

A staff member had been using the PC for a routine audit of tax information from several investment firms.

HMRC apologised for the breach, but said data on the PC had been stored securely.

It refused to comment on how many individuals were at risk, or how many financial institutions had their data stolen.

But inquiries by the BBC suggested the computer held data on around 400 customers with high value individual savings accounts (ISAs), at each of five different companies - including Standard Life and Liontrust.
An investigation by the BBC's Watchdog programme uncovered cases where mistakes by HMRC caused personal details to be sent to the wrong people.

The HMRC put together a dossier on Eric Tizzard's with details including his National Insurance number, date of birth, and every address he has ever worked and lived at.

But then they sent it all to the wrong person.

Identity fraud expert Julian Evans told the programme that with the details, someone could easily have applied for a credit card, loan or mortgage in Eric's name.

They could even access his bank account and withdraw money.
Documents found in Nottingham contained sensitive information and had been stamped by HRMC.

One gave details of the training of a customs officer, including details of interviews with passengers suspected of smuggling cigarettes via an airport.

HMRC said it reacted urgently and was investigating the matter.

The documents, found by a BBC reporter, included a VAT return of a man in Norwich, which showed how much he paid for the November 2005 to May 2006 period and his name and address.
HRMC lost sensitive account information belonging to customers of investment bank UBS Laing and Cruickshank.

A proposed agreement to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate as many as 6.3 million TD Ameritrade customers whose data was stolen by hackers would cost the Nebraska online brokerage firm less than $2 per victim and at least $1.8 million in fees to the attorneys who brokered the deal, according to an analysis of federal court documents filed Friday.

""The settlement provides the class members with fair, reasonable and adequate compensation for their claims,"" wrote lead counsel for the plaintiffs, Scott Kamber of KamberEdelson in New York.

Kamber, in a court filing (.pdf) in San Francisco federal court on Friday, is requesting $1,360 an hour – $1.8 million and counting for time worked by him and others in his and other firms for bringing the case and negotiating a proposed settlement to the breach-of-privacy class action.

The court filings came in response to a request by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who last month scuttled the proposed settlement agreement. Walker wanted an hourly accounting of the proposed legal fees, which are not unusually high by class action standards.

Most important, Walker was concerned the settlement agreement might not provide any real benefits to the customers whose data was stolen.

The data theft, disclosed in September, gave hackers access to customer names, phone numbers, e-mail accounts and home addresses. There is ""no evidence"" Social Security or account information was compromised, according to Ameritrade. According to the settlement, there is no ""evidence of identity theft."" Customers fell victim, however, to spam attacks.

The settlement agreement, while also demanding heightened data security, does not spell out whether lax security was cause for the breach. ID Analytics, a company specializing in identifying organized identity theft, and has been retained by Ameritrade to monitor security. The deal also demands that Ameritrade assist victims of identity theft at rewinding their financial mess.

A central element to the agreement is a provision giving affected customers a one-year subscription to spam-blocking software. The Trend Micro Internet Security Pro retails for about $70. TD Ameritrade said it struck a deal with Trend Micro to service the settlement agreement for about $6 million, the parties told Walker in court briefs on Friday. A solution for those using Apple computers was added to the deal.

In all, lawyers in the case said Ameritrade is likely to spend $10 million on the deal. With attorney's fees, the deal is expected to run the Nebraska company $12 million, or about $2 for every affected customer covered by the lawsuit.

""It is my understanding from information and belief that TD Ameritrade's cost associated with this settlement are well in excess of the $6 million paid to Trend Micro,"" Kamber wrote Judge Walker. ""Considering an undisclosed cost of ID Analytics as well as costs to comply with enhanced security, I believe the total costs of this settlement will approach $10 million.""

In an unusual twist, lead plaintiff Matthew Elvey, an IT computer consultant who signed the agreement, now says it's not good for customers and that he was ""threatened"" by his lawyers into signing it. Kamber wrote (.pdf) Walker, saying such a statement was a ""meritless accusation.""

Elvey, in a telephone interview, said Kamber's declaration was ""chock full of half-truths and outright lies.""

"20","Compass Bank","1,000,000","2008","Programmer who stole drive containing 1 million bank records gets 42 months
Only 250 customers notified of massive breach
A former programmer at Birmingham, Ala.-based Compass Bank who stole a hard drive containing 1 million customer records and used some of that information to commit debit-card fraud was sentenced last week to 42 months in prison by an Alabama district court judge.

James Kevin Real was also ordered to pay back the more than $32,000 that he and accomplice Laray Byrd fraudulently withdrew from customer accounts between May and July of last year using those counterfeit debit cards.

The Compass Bank compromise is one of the largest bank-related breaches yet revealed, in terms of the number of customer records that were potentially exposed. The incident, however, appears to have surfaced for the first time only after the Birmingham News carried a story on the sentencing last week.

Ed Bilek, a spokesman for the bank, said today that Real had used the information stolen from Compass Bank's database to create about 250 counterfeit debit cards. He was able to use about 45 of those cards to access and withdraw cash from customer accounts at the bank before he was arrested.

Court records associated with the case did not mention precisely how many customer records Real stole. But Bilek today said that the database on the hard drive Real stole contained ""limited information"" on about 1 million Compass Bank customers. He added that the records in the database were in a format that was not ""readily usable"" for committing fraud or for accessing customer account information easily. As a result, apart from the 250 or so individuals from whose accounts Real fraudulently withdrew money, no other customers were notified of the incident, Bilek said.

Bilek did not offer a clarification of what the bank meant when it said the data was stored in a format that was not ""readily usable.""

As of this February, Alabama was just one of 11 states that do not require companies to automatically notify consumers of data breaches involving the compromise of their personal data. In states that do require such notification, Compass Bank would have been required to notify all 1 million customers of the potential compromise of their data, if the information had been stored in unencrypted form on the stolen hard disk.

Some states even provide for penalties for companies that fail to promptly notify consumers of data breaches involving their personal data.

According to court documents, Real stole Compass' database information in May 2007. The database included customer names, account numbers and passwords. He then used the information from the database to make counterfeit debit cards using a magnetic strip encoder and software purchased by Byrd.

Malware loaded onto Hannaford servers let attackers intercept credit card data
Hannaford Brothers Cos, which earlier this month disclosed a data breach involving credit cards at its supermarket stores, this week shared more information with Massachusetts regulators about the ongoing investigation into the incident.

Hannaford Brothers Cos, which earlier this month disclosed a data breach involving credit cards at its supermarket stores, this week shared more information with Massachusetts regulators about the ongoing investigation into the incident.

In a letter to Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Gov. Deval Patrick’s Office of Consumer Affairs, Hannaford’s general counsel Emily Dickinson shared details that Hannaford is uncovering in its investigation.
The letter stated that malware loaded onto Hannaford servers allowed attackers to intercept card data stored on the magnetic stripe of payment cards as customer’s used them at the check-out counter, according to information Hannaford provided to the Massachusetts Attorney General. That information, taken in transit from the point of sale, included card number and expiration date but not the customer’s name. The attack resulted in card data being transferred overseas and has resulted in 2,000 known cases of fraud.

“It’s an evolving situation,” said Carol Eleazer, vice president of marketing at Hannaford, noting that the computer forensics reports have not yet been completed on the data-breach incident.

Hannaford’s security investigators, whom she wasn’t at liberty to name, are calling the attack “sophisticated.” She said the U.S. Secret Service is also involved in finding out how the data breach occurred.

The attack was successful in spite of the fact that Hannaford is compliant with the Payment Card Industry rules for proving adherence to the PCI data security standards by undergoing an elaborate — and usually expensive — examination and certification required by card associations, including Visa and MasterCard.
PCI also has requirements for periodic vulnerability scans. Hannaford says it received PCI certification last year and was recertified on February 27.

Not surprisingly, the Hannaford data-breach case has already elicited a few customer lawsuits. 

Some analysts regard the ongoing Hannaford case as raising important and unanswered questions about PCI and its purpose.

If the attackers in the Hannaford case initially captured data from the point-of-sale device to a server in the store, they may have known that data isn’t required under PCI to be encrypted at that point, notes Avivah Litan, vice president at Gartner and an expert in computer network security used in retailing.

“PCI only calls for the need to encrypt across an open network, usually the Internet or wireless,” says Litan. “In retailing, you almost never encrypt between the cash register point of sale and the store server.”

As more information about the Hannaford data breach becomes known, there may be some industry effort to broaden the encryption requirement. However, Litan’s opinion is that requiring additional encryption would not necessarily be a good move because it would entail huge costs to retailers processing card data. Besides, she points out, the vulnerability scanning called for in PCI should address server weaknesses that would allow malware to be loaded onto a server.

Litan says the second point about PCI raised by the Hannaford case is where the financial liability for the card-related fraud losses lies.

The industry’s PCI mandate generally implies businesses that are PCI-compliant do not have to bear the cost burden of fraud resulting from criminals using cards obtained through a known data breach.

Under PCI, that financial burden would fall on the business’ bank (known as the acquiring bank) seeking to get its money back from a card-issuing bank when a data breach resulted in card fraud. The card associations, such as Visa, are also part of the resolution process under PCI, which hasn’t yet been tested in any known case.

“This all becomes who’s responsible,” says Litan, who said the Hannaford case may end up being one that casts light on how these important legal and financial concepts related to PCI play out in a real-world situation.

If PCI doesn’t offer any cover for businesses that go through the PCI certification process, notes Litan, the question will be why exactly should they be doing it?

Litan adds that the customer lawsuits filed against Hannaford are a separate matter legally that are bound to have an impact on the entire matter, as will any influence exerted by state or federal regulators.

Eleazer at Hannaford said the company has no immediate response to these complex legal questions, though it’s aware of the PCI rules. She says Hannaford regards PCI as “the gold standard for the industry.” Eleazer also said the company expects to share more about what occurred in the data breach “for the good of the retailing industry.”

“Our first priority is to our customers and our relationship with them,” she concluded.

Hannaford earlier acknowledged about 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers used at its supermarket stores in six states were compromised between Dec. 7 and March 10. It told the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office that it now believes  the attack involved the installation of malware on servers in 300 stores.","retail","3",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Malware"

BOSTON (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp lost the Social Security numbers and other information of about 4.5 million customers when a box of data storage tapes went missing in February, Connecticut’s attorney general said.

“I am alarmed and deeply concerned by a recent and serious data breach at The Bank of New York Mellon involving the loss of computer backup tapes,” Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said in a statement on Wednesday.

The computer storage tapes were unencrypted, containing sensitive information of 4.5 million consumers, he added.

The man accused of stealing customer data from home mortgage lender Countrywide probably was able to download and save the data to an external drive due to an oversight by the company's IT department.

On Friday, Rene Rebollo, a former senior financial analyst at Countrywide, was arrested for his alleged role in stealing customer data and selling it (Compare Data Leak Protection products).

U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavits show that Rebollo told special agents that he knew most computers in the office had a security feature that disabled the use of a thumb drive. However, he discovered that one computer didn't have this feature.

On a weekly basis, often on Sundays, Rebollo would collect customer names per request by his buyers and download them onto his personal thumb drive using that one computer in the office, according to the documents. Rebollo might specifically collect names of people who recently declined an offer of a loan by Countrywide, for example.

Over a two-year period, Rebollo estimated he downloaded approximately 20,000 customer profiles each week and sold files with that many names for $500, according to the affidavit. The profiles included Social Security numbers and other contact details about the people. He typically would e-mail the data in Excel spreadsheets to his buyers, often using computers at Kinko's copying and business center stores.

Countrywide's owner, Bank of America, has not responded to a request for information about the type of security it employs to prevent this type of theft. According to a statement from the FBI last week, Countrywide said it is analyzing the stolen data to determine whether any customer identities have been compromised. If they have, the company said it will notify the customers, according to the FBI statement.

While it's not clear what type of security Countrywide employs that disables the use of thumb drives, it may use software that includes an agent on all computers that IT administrators can set to control how each port on the computer can be used. Such products can allow administrators to set rules that allow certain employees to access certain ports, or set rules that define what types of files can be copied to certain ports, said Pat Clawson, chairman and CEO of Lumension Security, a company that sells such software. If this is the method Countrywide uses, its administrators may have accidentally failed to install the agent on the computer that Rebollo discovered.

But that type of vulnerability can be avoided, Clawson said. Companies should have policies that require any device that touches the network to be checked. ""No matter if that device is a laptop or a handheld, it has to go through some sort of scanning process to find if they have all the requisite materials before you allow them to access the network. It's clear that didn't happen here,"" he said.

Many companies that handle sensitive data also have systems that enforce encryption rules and prevent most workers from copying sensitive data, Clawson noted.

Some organizations have resorted to far more ""draconian"" methods to try to prevent this type of theft, Clawson said. For a time, many U.S. government agencies filled USB ports with hot glue and drove plastic screws into microphones in an effort to prevent access to them, he said.

The FBI collected some of the customer data allegedly stolen by Rebollo by working with confidential witnesses who agreed to buy the data from one of Rebollo's customers, Wahid Siddiqi, who was also arrested last week. The witnesses then turned the data over to the FBI agents. Countrywide matched those numbers provided by the FBI with its own internal spreadsheets, confirming that the names were from its customers and were paired with accurate Social Security numbers.

In two years, Rebollo estimated he earned $50,000 to $70,000 on the activity. His Countrywide salary was $65,000 per year, according to the documents.

Rebollo initially cooperated with FBI agents, describing his actions to them and willingly giving them one of his home computers and a thumb drive, according to the affidavit. But he later seemed to have changed his mind. A few days after his meeting with the agents, Rebollo's lawyer told the FBI that he had decided to revoke his consent to search the drive and the computer.

Rebollo, who faces as much as five years in federal prison if convicted, was released on an $80,000 bond last week even though he doesn't appear ready to give up his activities, at least according to the affidavits. FBI agents said that six days after they spoke with Rebollo, when he described how he stole and sold the data, he called a witness offering to sell him more Countrywide customer names.","financial","3",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Intentional_Data_Leak"

RBS WorldPay belatedly admitted last week that hackers broke into its systems.

The attack against the electronic payment services firm leaves to to 1.5 million payroll and gift card holders in the US at risk of fraud. Up to 1.1 million social security records were also exposed as a result of the breach.

The affected pre-paid cards include payroll cards and open-loop gift cards. PINs for all PIN-enabled cards are being reset as a precaution. RBS WorldPay has pledged to make sure its customers are not left out of pocket as a result of any fraud stemming from the attack. The firm is also offering 12 months complimentary membership to a credit monitoring service to those whose personal information was exposed as a result of the breach.

RBS WorldPay notified law enforcement and regulators about the attack on 10 November but waited until 23 December before publishing advice to potentially affected customers. The timing of its announcement raises suspicions that the firm is releasing bad news at a time when it is likely to go largely unnoticed.

The attack has been linked to the fraudulent misuse of 100 payroll cards, all of which have since been deactivated.

Chinese attacker asks for ransom on data, reports say
South Korea’s largest online shopping site earlier this month was attacked by a Chinese hacker who made off with the user information on 18 million members and a large amount of financial data.

According to reports on Hack in the Box and the Web Application Security Consortium Incident Report, Auction.co.kr has disclosed the theft of data from some 18 million buyers and sellers.

The attack was launched from China's internet. After the incident, Auction.co.kr received a phone call offering to exchange the user information for money, the reports said.

According to a report on Dark Visitor, a security blog site, the Chinese hacker did not directly attack the server. The hacker sent out bulk emailings to the auction staff containing “hacker procedures"" that may have contained malware. When the staff members confirmed the emails, the hacker was able to gain their IDs. The hacker was then able to log into the Auction server using the staffer’s ID.

The WASC report categorizes the exploit as a cross-site request forgery attack. ""The attack description is vague, but can be best described as session hijacking,"" the organization said.

Auction.co.kr waited 20 hours after the attack before confirming the loss of information, according to the Chinese site Hackbase.com. Korean users rebuked the Website for being too slow to act, the reports said.

The incident occurred around Feb. 12, but it has gone largely unreported. ""In the U.S. this would be front news,"" the WASC report said.

Two multimedia discs containing the personal information of 11.1 million customers of GS Caltex, one of the nation`s largest oil refineries, was found on the street, police said yesterday.

Police have not yet confirmed any damage caused by the leak, but this is considered the countrys largest leak of its kind given the number of people involved.

In February, the personal data of 10.8 million customers were leaked when the online shopping mall Auction.co.kr was hacked.

The Cyber Terror Response Center of the National Police Agency dispatched two detectives to GS Caltex headquarters in southern Seoul to investigate.

The discs -- one DVD and a CD-Rom which are believed to have been thrown away -- were found early this month by an office worker in a backstreets trash pile near Gangnam subway station in Seoul.

The DVD contained 76 files in a folder named GS Caltex, including the names, social security numbers, addresses, cell phone numbers, email addresses and workplaces of customers sorted by age. The CD-Rom is believed to be a sample of the DVD as it contains only a few peoples personal data.

We received the CD around 3 p.m. Thursday and have been comparing the personal information with the one stored in our own server, a GS Caltex source told reporters.

We have tentatively concluded that it is membership information collected for the bonus card issued by our company. The bonus card offers discounts for fill-ups, and is mainly issued by gas stations to compile customers personal information.

The bonus card in question contains no credit card or bank account details, as it is a simple card that cannot make purchases, says senior GS Caltex executive Na Wan-bae. There has been no trace of hacking. And no one has made threatening phone calls using the list.

Experts say a GS Caltex employee likely stole the information for personal purposes given no signs of hacking and the anti-hacking system being intact.

For now, we are investigating the case while taking all possibilities into account, including hacking and leaks by its own employee, a police official said. We can charge both the person who leaked the information and the company for violating the law on telecom networks and information protection.","energy","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

It's just another in a long line of stolen laptops ... unless you work in management at AT&T and you're worried about your social security number falling into the hands of identity thieves. Or, you're worried that your coworkers might find out how much -- or how little -- you actually earn.

While AT&T has declined to disclose the number of management employees put at risk by the May 15 theft from an employee's car, one manager who is among them tells me he knows of others located throughout every corner of AT&T's vast empire in the U.S. ""I have found one individual who was not impacted,"" says the manager, who asked not to be named. ""This is probably big, but not everyone.""

""I'm very disappointed in my company,"" he adds. ""Eight days passed before we were notified ... and it took up to another 10 days to be informed about requesting a fraud alert and to be given instructions for signing up for credit watch.""

I've asked AT&T for comment. At the end of this post is a long excerpt from a Q&A the company provided to employees, who learned of the breach via an e-mail, which reads in part:

""This is to alert you to the recent theft of an AT&T employee's laptop computer that contained AT&T management compensation information, including employee names, Social Security numbers, and, in most cases, salary and bonus information. ... We deeply regret this incident. You will soon hear about additional steps we're taking to reinforce our policies to safeguard sensitive personal information and ensure strict compliance in order to avoid incidents like this in the future.""

Regrets were not enough to allay the anger of this manager.

""It is pathetic that the largest telecom company in the world -- with more than 100 million customers -- doesn't encrypt basic personal information,"" he says.

Failure to encrypt and otherwise better protect such data is inexcusable at this point in time, agrees Kelly Todd, a staff member at attrition.org, a security site that maintains a database of data-breach incidents.

""Lack of encryption of personal data is generally troubling, especially when the data is being stored on any mobile device with a 'steal me' bulls-eye on it,"" says Todd. ""According to part of the AT&T e-mail, 'It was not encrypted, but the laptop was password protected. AT&T is currently in the process of encrypting such systems.' Good for them, but larger companies can sometimes have tens of thousands of systems to identify, plan for, and then execute an encryption process. It seems to me that they should have been 'in the process' a year ago.

""Even more troubling is that AT&T mentions that the laptop was password protected in their letter,"" he adds. ""It might make some people feel better, but just password protection alone is generally considered a security joke.""

The AT&T manager whose data was exposed sees an even larger issue in play here.

""I receive company internal e-mails reminding me to contact our legislators about relieving the company of the burdens of regulation,"" he says. ""What happened here shows the company isn't ready to have those burdens lifted.""

Here's the meat of that Q&A from AT&T:

When and where did this happen?

The laptop was stolen on May 15 from an employee's vehicle, and the employee notified a supervisor upon discovering the theft. The case is under active police investigation; we're not providing any further details.

Why aren't you disclosing the location?

We believe that the theft was a random property crime and, in most of these cases, the hard-drive is wiped clean and the computer is re-sold for profit. We do not want to potentially notify the thief of the nature of the data on the hard-drive.

What kind of information was on the laptop?

The laptop contained a file listing names, Social Security numbers and salary and bonus payments for a number of AT&T management employees.

Has any of this personal information been compromised?

We have no reason to believe this information has been compromised. We are working closely with local law enforcement to investigate the crime and to attempt to recover the laptop.

How many employees are affected?

It is our policy not to provide that information.

Why did the employee have the information on his/her laptop?

The employee and business unit had access to the data as part of normal work functions. We're not providing any additional detail on the circumstances.

Was it encrypted? If not, why not?

It was not encrypted, but the laptop was password protected. AT&T is currently in the process of encrypting such systems.

How could this have happened?

This was a criminal act by an unknown person. AT&T is taking proactive measures to remind employees of the need to protect company property to avoid such incidents in the future.

What are the proactive measures?

Managers throughout the company will be responsible for ensuring compliance with existing standards for use of mobile computing devices by both employees and vendors. These standards include encrypting sensitive data and physically securing devices containing such data.

Why weren't those standards followed in this case?

The measures and precautions we put in place to protect the security of company-owned property and our employees' personal information were not followed. We will continue to remind our employees in the strongest terms what the policies and expectations are, and we will enforce those policies across-the-board, without exception.

We'll leave the last word to the manager whose personal info was put at risk:

""Water-cooler buzz is really just beginning,"" he says of the reaction within the company. ""Lots of anger - both that the information was compromised and that the person responsible was just disciplined. We absorb the entire risk of identity theft and the individual gets off with 'discipline.'

""I expect, after the outrage of SSN and payroll dies down, there will still be anger that 'personal responsibility' means nothing. If this doesn't get you fired - what does?""","telecoms","1",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

STANFORD Tens of thousands of workers at university at risk of ID theft
Stanford University has notified tens of thousands of past and current Stanford University employees that their personal information - including their dates of birth, Social Security numbers and home addresses - was on the hard drive of a stolen university laptop.

A Stanford spokesman said Saturday that the stolen computer contained personal information on people hired by the university before Sept. 28, 2007, which could be as many as 72,000 people. Stanford sent out an e-mail message Friday to all the current and former employees it could reach, advising them of the theft.

""While there is no evidence that any of the information on the stolen laptop has been accessed, the University is committed to taking steps to assist individuals whose personal data may be misused,"" Stanford Chief Financial Officer Randy Livingston wrote in the e-mail.

With the theft, Stanford becomes the latest in a series of big institutions - from Wells Fargo Bank to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs - to face security breaches from a stolen laptop. The risk in such cases is that criminals may use personal data from the stolen computer to create fake credit accounts in the name of unknowing victims.
Stanford officials would not provide any details on the theft, such as when or where the computer was stolen.

They said data on the laptop included some or all of the following: employees' names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, business titles, work and home phone numbers, home addresses, salaries, and Stanford e-mail addresses and employee identification numbers.

The laptop did not contain driver's license, bank account or credit card numbers. Nor did it include information on employees of Stanford University Hospital or the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

The university said it will provide additional credit monitoring to help employees respond to the possible data breach and protect their identities from fraud. It is also looking at how to protect employee data better in the future.

""We will have services in place next week and Stanford is committed to assuming this cost,"" the e-mail to employees said.

Stanford is far from alone in facing privacy problems stemming from stolen laptops.

A 2007 study by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy think tank in Traverse City, Mich., estimated that 73 percent of corporations experienced the loss or theft of a data-bearing portable device such as a laptop in the preceding two years.

Wells Fargo had two laptops stolen in 2003 and 2004 that held data on thousands of mortgage and home-loan customers. The Department of Veterans Affairs had a computer stolen in 2006 that held confidential information on over 25 million veterans and military personnel.

UC Berkeley faced a similar problem in 2005 when someone stole a laptop containing confidential data on more than 98,000 graduate students and applicants.

""One group of organizations that seems to be the worst offenders with breaches of this sort is colleges and universities,"" said Mike Spinney, a Ponemon Institute spokesman.

In the Berkeley case, investigators recovered the laptop about six months later when it was being offered for sale on eBay - with no apparent misuse of the student data.

Stanford officials said in their e-mail that they believe the theft of Stanford's laptop was a similarly unsophisticated crime.

""We believe that the perpetrator of the crime was not seeking the records on the computer or even aware of them,"" Livingston wrote. ""Often, such thefts are property crimes in which the laptop's hard drive is erased before the laptop is resold.""

But one computer security expert said that thieves are becoming increasingly savvy about the value of personal data on computers, and that a flourishing black market for stolen data has emerged over the past several years.

""In the past, if a laptop was stolen from a cafe, it was reasonable to think it would be reformatted and sold as a new machine,"" said Robert Richardson, director of the San Francisco-based Computer Security Institute. ""Now I wouldn't make that assumption. Even the dumbest criminals out there are on to the fact that the data is where the money is.""

Personal information such as Social Security numbers and birth dates are valuable commodities in the underground world of identity theft. Criminals can use this kind of data to take out loans or open credit accounts in the name of an unknowing victim.

Someone who steals a laptop with personal information doesn't necessarily need to know how to commit identity fraud personally - just where to sell the information.

""The typical person who steals a laptop sells the data for a couple of bucks a record,"" Richardson said. ""Then somebody else figures out what to do with it.""","academic","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

Courier left data in car, which was burglarized
University of Utah Hospital and Clinics patients are bracing for the unknown as police and prosecutors investigate the theft of 2.2 million billing records filled with personal information.

Authorities say the records, stolen out of a courier's personal vehicle earlier this month, put the private data of patients from the past 16 years at risk.

Tuesday's news was especially unsettling for people like Will Taylor, of West Valley City, whose premature daughter is a patient at University Hospital. Taylor has already been the victim of identity theft once, when thieves racked up credit card charges in his name.

Even so, he was not panicking yet.

""I will ask [the hospital] what precautions I can take and what they are doing about it,"" he said.

Measures so far include offering free credit monitoring services for at least 1.3 million patients whose Social Security numbers were compromised, and a $1,000 reward for the return of the tapes - no questions asked.

Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder and Lorris Betz, a senior vice president for health sciences for University Health Care, say the stolen records were on backup tapes designed to safeguard the records in case materials housed in the hospitals and clinics were destroyed.

The tapes were taken from the vehicle of an employee of Sandy-based Perpetual Storage Inc. near the employee's Kearns home on June 2.

The employee had been assigned to pick up the tapes in a secure company van and transport them to an off-site vault, said James Nowa, a vice president for sales and marketing for Perpetual Storage. He violated company policy by taking them home and leaving them in his car.

A thief then broke into the employee's vehicle near 5200 South and 5000 West, stealing a metal box holding the tapes, Winder said.

Nowa said the 18-year veteran employee has been fired, and the incident is the first of its kind he knows of in the company's 40-year history.

An investigation is ongoing, but the theft appears to be the work of inexperienced criminals who likely believed the metal box containing the tapes was filled with cash, said Winder. After collaborating with the FBI, Winder said it's unlikely the tapes were stolen to commit identity theft.

There's no evidence any of the information on the tapes has been accessed; besides, anyone trying to use the tapes would need specialized equipment to view the contents, Winder said.

But there are also no guarantees.

""If our information isn't safe, then what is?"" patient Dan Christenson, of Salt Lake City, said Tuesday after learning of the theft.

Christenson regularly monitors his credit and bank accounts online. He said he now will check those reports more frequently.

Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, said the FBI and the Utah Identity Task Force, which includes local and county law enforcement agencies, is investigating the thefts. She warned of federal penalties for anyone who uses stolen identities.

Betz said the university delayed releasing news of the security breach to the public until the sheriff's office had completed an initial investigation.

""We understand this is unwelcome news to our patients,"" said Betz.

The university had worked with Perpetual Storage for 12 years before the theft but suspended deliveries after the incident, Betz said. An assessment of university data security policies and procedures is under way, he said.","academic","4",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

But sometime after the polls closed on election night, the two laptops were stolen from a building at Tonsler Park. On the computers were the names, addresses, birth years and DMV customer numbers of more than 25,000 registered voters.   

The city contends that the risk of identity theft is low.  ""They've got to get through three levels of passwords in order to even turn the computer on.  The most likely scenario is that whoever stole these computers tried to turn them on and realized they were useless and they dumped them somewhere,"" said Rick Sincere with the Charlottesville Electoral Board.

Sincere adds that the laptops were set up so people could access the data only on Election Day. Information is still on the laptops, but it's not in any readable form.

As for liability, Charlottesville says it's not at fault. City spokesperson Ric Barrick says police told the city not to say anything about the theft because it was part of an ongoing investigation. Barrick also points to a ""reasonable amount of time"" clause as a defense as well. 

If you have any information about the missing laptops, call Crime Stoppers at 434-977-4000.

The city has claimed that the information on the computers was a public record and that no social security numbers are in the records. Half of that is true.

The laptops had voters' driver’s license numbers on them. Seven out of every 1,000 drivers Virginia still have their social security numbers as their driver’s license numbers. The DMV numbers are not public information available through voting lists or anywhere else, despite the city's claims.

Late Friday afternoon the state board of elections told us that the vendor supplying the polling software reviewed all 25,000 names in the Charlottesville lists scanning for social security numbers in the driver’s license field. They tell us none were found.

Data on lottery winners copied
Commission says 89,000 affected by security breach
AUSTIN — The Texas Lottery Commission is alerting tens of thousands of lottery winners that they're on a not-so-lucky list.

More than 89,000 lottery winners are being notified that sensitive information about them including their names, Social Security numbers, addresses and prize amounts were taken from the agency without permission by a former employee.

The 39-year-old computer analyst, who left the state commission last year after eight years on the job, apparently copied onto computer disks sensitive information on thousands of lottery commission employees, retailers and vendors, as well.

The employee, who told investigators he eventually copied the data onto his work computer at the Texas Comptroller's Office, has not been charged. The case is being investigated by the Travis County District Attorney's office.

Starbucks Corp. confirmed Monday that a laptop containing private information on 97,000 employees was stolen Oct. 29. The information included names, addresses and Social Security numbers, according to an undated memo addressed to affected employees.


""We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved a breach of your private information,"" said the memo, which was posted at Starbucksgossip.com and was verified as authentic by Starbucks spokeswoman Deb Trevino on Monday.


Although Starbucks’ representatives have no evidence of data being misused, the corporation offered free credit monitoring. This isn't the first time a Starbucks laptop has gone missing.

A missing computer hard drive may have contained details of 1.7 million people who had enquired about joining the armed forces, the government has said.

The drive was reported missing last week by EDS, a firm contracted to the Ministry of Defence.

Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth told MPs the information, which went missing at an EDS site in Hampshire, was ""unlikely"" to have been encrypted.

It is not known if the drive was lost or stolen. An investigation has begun.
In a written statement, Mr Ainsworth said the drive ""may, in the worst case, contain details relating to 1.7 million individuals who have enquired about joining the armed forces"".

Bank details

While some who had made ""casual enquiries"" would only have given a name and contact details, ""more extensive personal data"" may have been held on those who had applied to join, he said.

""In some cases this will include personal information such as next of kin details, passport and National Insurance numbers, drivers' licence and bank details and National Health Service number,"" he said.
""EDS assesses that it is unlikely that the device was encrypted because it was stored within a secure site that exceeded the standards necessary for restricted information.""

Banks of those who may have had financial details on the disc drive have been informed and the Ministry of Defence police are investigating.

The disc drive was found to be missing during an audit at the site. Mr Ainsworth said a review into MoD data security showed a ""crucial need to implement wholesale improvements"".

In September it emerged details of up to 500,000 former servicemen and women, held on three portable disc drives at RAF Innsworth in Gloucestershire, had gone missing.

'Serial incompetence'

In July the MoD said 658 of its laptops had been stolen over four years and 26 portable memory sticks had been stolen or misplaced since the start of the year.

For the Conservatives, shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said: ""This is another symptom of serial incompetence displayed by this government when it comes to data control.

""It seems incomprehensible that we are still learning the details of this dreadful incident.""

Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Nick Harvey said: ""This data loss is an absolute scandal and on a far larger scale than previously feared.""

He said the missing information was ""a potential goldmine for organised crime and could even compromise national security"".

""In the past soldiers have been targeted by extremists. One dreads to think what might happen if this information were to fall into the wrong hands,"" he added.","government","5",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

	Deutsche Telekom was on Sunday hit by a fresh scandal over the way it handles confidential information after it admitted losing the personal details of 17m customers, the largest data theft to date in Germany.

The theft at the company’s mobile operation T-Mobile included the names, addresses and mobile phone numbers of high-profile politicians, celebrities and business leaders, although no bank details or credit card numbers were disclosed.

The news dealt a blow to efforts to restore Deutsche Telekom’s reputation following allegations that former management hired private detectives to spy on directors and journalists. It also handed fresh ammunition to the growing ranks of politicians in Berlin calling for tougher data protection laws.

The data breach was uncovered after Der Spiegel magazine said it managed to access customer information via a third party. Deutsche Telekom reported the theft to state prosecutors in 2006 but assumed there had been no dissemination of the data.

The company said it had conducted “extensive research” after the loss occurred but had found no indication that the data was available for sale on the black market.

However, it only brought the incident to the attention of the German interior ministry last week.

“We can only apologise to our customers,” chief executive René Obermann told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “The whole thing is a very exasperating incident.”

The company has set up a hotline to field any customer concerns but it said there was no evidence the data had been misused.

The Der Spiegel report revealed that among those people affected by the data breach were members of parliament, ministers, former federal presidents and business leaders. The German interior ministry said it was conducting a risk assessment to examine the implications of the breach.

T-Mobile said it has since improved data security measures, including much greater restriction of access rights to customer data.

For Mr Obermann, the admission that Deutsche Telekom had lost such critical information marked a new low for the former state telecommunications group’s battered corporate image.

Prosecutors raided the company’s Bonn headquarters in May as part of a probe into allegations that Klaus Zumwinkel, former chairman, Kai-Uwe Ricke, ex-chief executive, and six other employees had commissioned a spying campaign. The executives have denied any wrongdoing.

Deutsche Telekom admitted passing information to authorities that staff had in 2005 and 2006 ordered the monitoring of phone bills to find out who was leaking sensitive corporate information. Mr Zumwinkel had quit the company three months prior to the raid after he was named a suspect in a tax-evasion case.

"38","Norwegian Tax Authorities","3,950,000","2008","LARGEST DATA LEAK IN NORWAY: DATA ON 4 MILLION NORWEGIANS SENT TO MEDIA

OSLO - Norway's national tax office mistakenly sent confidential information about nearly 85% of Norwegian adults to nine major media groups, an error the government described as ""extremely serious.""

Tax authorities said they had sent CD-ROMs filled with the 2006 tax returns of nearly four million people living in Norway, a country of just 4.6 million inhabitants, to the editorial staff at national newspapers, radios and television stations.
While tax statements are open to public scrutiny in the Scandinavian country, the so-called personal number (like a social security number) inscribed on each form is highly confidential. The number can for instance be used to change a person's home address, reroute their mail and purchase products on their account.
The tax authorities, who have requested that the CD-ROMs be returned, stressed that the documents could only be opened by using a secret code, which it insisted limited the possibility that the personal numbers would be widely distributed.
In Norway tax returns have been publicly available since 1863, but only accessible online since 2002. Details include name, age, income and address, and can be matched with searchable online directories such as the phone book to obtain home, work and mobile numbers along with professional details for a full portrait of an individual.

Nikolay Fedotov, Infowatch senior analyst comments:
“Wise Wang Fu Jing once said: “There’s a secret – there’s a problem. No secret – no problem”. Probably Chinese philosopher would consider introduction of the Norwegian personal numbers (like SSN in USA) an erroneous decision. Personal number – is a confidential number, with which you can identify your personality remotely. There’s no such in Russia. We have “Please come with passport personally” instead. More messy but definitely more secure solution.
Method of the confidential SSN was invented before the network era. Now it brings more problems than solutions. Unfortunately, it would be extremely hard to swap it for anything else. In the end, however, change is inevitable.","government","2",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is investigating the theft of computer files holding the records of thousands of serving and former RAF staff.

The information was stored on computer hard drives at the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency at the RAF Innsworth site near Gloucester.

The theft of the files took place on 17 September, within a high-security area on the base.

The MoD has set up a helpline for people who have been affected.
It said it was treating the breach ""extremely seriously"".

900,000 personnel

A spokesman for the MoD police said: ""We can confirm that an investigation is being conducted by MoD police, with the support of Gloucestershire Police into the apparent theft of three USB portable hard disk drives.

""In view of the ongoing nature of police inquiries, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.""

It is not yet clear how many people's records were affected.

But two of the drives are believed to have contained potentially sensitive personal data, while the third hard drive did not contain any personal data.

It is thought the missing drives contain appraisal forms which included names, dates of birth, service numbers, and bosses' opinions of staff.

The spokesman said the email addresses are MoD e-mail addresses and bank details are contained in a minority of cases.

The agency provides support services for some 900,000 serving and ex-service personnel.

Nick Harvey, Lib Dem defence spokesman, said: ""This is just the latest in a seemingly endless stream of stories involving personal information being lost or stolen.

""The first priority has to be ensuring that nobody's security has been put at risk, but we also need a serious look at the way such sensitive data is being handled.

""The current situation is unacceptable.""

Former shadow minister for homeland security, Patrick Mercer, said if the theft was an ""internal job"" he would be even more concerned.

""If this was some sort of opportunity theft by, you know, 'Joe Burglar' - fine.

""But if we're saying that this is an internal job which is targeted at some specific form of information, then I'm afraid my alarm bells ring even more.""

Former government defence advisor Air Vice Marshall Tony Mason, from Cheltenham, said: ""If the material was important enough to be in a high security department, locked in a high security cabinet, there should be a record of that material going in and out.

""One thing I couldn't establish was what proportion of the information has gone astray, but I would be very, very surprised if this was a break-in from outside.""

The systems penetrated by a malicious keylogger could result in a data breach that rivals the parent company of TJ Maxx in 2007.

Heartland Payment Systems, a leading payment processing company, reported on Tuesday that its systems had been compromised by malware in 2008.

The data breach could turn out to rival the massive breach reported by TJX in 2007, which affected as many as 94 million credit card accounts. Heartland handles 100 million transactions per month for more than 250,000 businesses. But the company isn't yet ready to disclose the number of credit card accounts affected.

""We found evidence of an intrusion last week and immediately notified federal law enforcement officials as well as the card brands,"" said Robert H.B. Baldwin Jr., Heartland's president and CFO, in a statement. ""We understand that this incident may be the result of a widespread global cyberfraud operation, and we are cooperating closely with the United States Secret Service and Department of Justice.""

Heartland was alerted to the breach by reports of suspicious transactions from Visa and MasterCard.

In a phone interview, Baldwin said that the bulk of the exposed data consisted of credit card numbers and expiration dates, and that a subset of the exposed data also included credit card names.

Baldwin said his company couldn't yet reveal an accurate number of exposed accounts. ""There are some numbers flying around now that aren't based on any discussion that Heartland has had with anyone,"" he said. ""They are speculation. ...We just discovered this last week. We have been working around the clock to get data out to the public because it's consequential and we think it's important to be transparent on this.""

In its statement about the breach, Heartland said that no merchant data, cardholder Social Security numbers, unencrypted personal identification numbers (PIN), addresses, or telephone numbers were exposed.

Baldwin said his company wasn't yet ready to disclose the dates when its network was exposed. ""We can say, however, that this is fully contained,"" he said. ""That is both our view and the view of the forensic auditors we brought in to work on this issue.""

Baldwin said that the breach was the result of keylogging malware, which covertly captures anything typed on an infected computer, such as user names and passwords.

""There were two elements to it, one of which was a keylogger that got through our firewall,"" he said. ""Then subsequently it was able to propagate a sniffer onto some of the machines in our network. And those are what was actually grabbing the transactions as they floated over our network.""

A sniffer is similar in concept to a keylogger, but rather than merely capturing keystrokes, a sniffer captures entire data packets on a network.

Asked whether the data was read remotely from a locally stored file or transmitted to an external site, Baldwin said, ""We don't know in what way there was egress or to what extent,"" he said. ""And that's one of the frustrating things about this. We know that a lot of transactions go across our network; we don't know the percentage of transactions that the sniffer was able to grab. And we don't know the percentage of those that the bad guys were able to access.""

He added that while investigators considered the possibility that an insider might have been involved, there was no information that suggested any insider involvement.

While the company's Web site says the company handles more than 4 billion transactions per year, Baldwin said only about 1 billion of those were on the legacy Heartland network that was breached. The remaining 3 billion, the result of an acquisition the company made last May of the network services division of Alliance Data Systems, go over a separate network, which wasn't affected by the breach, he said.

He added that while the company handles roughly 100 million transactions per month, the number of unique credit card numbers processed is significantly less than that because some transactions represent the same credit card number being used at different merchants. While the actual total of affected accounts will depend on the number of months that Heartland's network was exposed, Baldwin said the company wasn't yet ready to disclose a specific estimate.

Baldwin said that in addition to an undisclosed system that's being implemented to shore up the Heartland network's defenses, his company is taking a variety of other steps to improve security.

He explained, ""There are a host of things we didn't go into that we're implementing, some larger, some smaller, all of which are designed to say, 'OK, we had a commitment to high security. We were PCI compliant -- that was certified in April of last year. Yet we had this problem. Clearly we need to do more.' So our IT team is implementing as many additional precautions as it can as quickly as possible.

""We are really crushed by this,"" said Baldwin. ""It's absolutely antithetical to everything Heartland stands for. We will therefore be redoubling our efforts to be the best processor out there. We obviously are pained by the inconvenience any consumers will have and look forward to coming out of this a stronger company.""

If this data breach represents heartache for Heartland, security vendors see it as an opportunity to play doctor. ""As the Heartland breach illustrates, you can be PCI compliant and still be breached,"" said Phil Neray, VP of security strategy at database security company Guardium, in an e-mailed statement. ""Good compliance doesn't mean good security.""

Employee's laptop containing personal data was stolen over holiday weekend
Army says data guarded by layers of security and encryption
Military sent letter to those affected two weeks after theft
Risk assessment forced lag in announcement, military says
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The personal records of thousands of soldiers, employees and their families were potentially exposed after a laptop computer containing the information was stolen over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the military says.

But information security experts for the Army say it's unlikely that the information will be compromised because the data are guarded by three layers of security and encryption passwords.

The security breach happened when the rental apartment of an employee with the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Academy was burglarized in Clermont, Florida, officials said. The theft was reported to local police November 28, but the military was not notified until the employee returned to work three days later.

Military officials say the employee was using the laptop for remote training courses, and it has not been determined whether any protocol was breached.

The computer contained ""names and personally identifiable information for slightly more than 42,000 Fort Belvoir Morale, Welfare and Recreation patrons,"" according to a posting on the Web site for the fort, which is in Virginia.

CNN obtained the notification letter sent, almost two weeks later, to those affected. It says, in part, that the alleged compromised information ""includes your name, Social Security number, home address, date of birth, encrypted credit card information, personal e-mail address, personal telephone numbers, and family member information.""

The letter recommends steps to guard against the possibility of identity theft.

The military says the lag in notification time was because of a policy requiring risk assessment before alerting those affected.

The Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Command operates facilities such as child care centers, bowling centers and outdoor recreation facilities. Those facilities are available to anyone with a military ID, which includes active-duty troops, Department of Defense civilians, family members and retirees.

This isn't the first time a missing laptop has resulted in a potential security breach for the military.

In 2006, a Veterans Affairs Department analyst lost a laptop computer that contained the Social Security numbers and other personal data for more than 26 million veterans and active duty troops.

That incident, in addition to other major data breaches, prompted a national call for protection of personal information. A bill currently under consideration in the Senate would put more protections in place.","government","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

Earlier today news spread that social application site RockYou had suffered a data breached that resulted in the exposure of over 32 Million user accounts. To compound the severity of the security breach, it was found that RockYou  are storing all user account data in plain text in their database, exposing all that information to attackers. RockYou have yet to inform users of the breach, and their blog is eerily silent – but the details of the security breach are going from bad to worse.

The first issue is that RockYou attempted to downplay the entire incident, first by covering it up by not notifying users and then downplaying it in an official statement as being an issue that only affected ‘older’ applications. The hacker responsible for the initial breach published a small portion of the dataset he had retrieved and was able to show that not only did he have access to their entire database, but also passwords were stored in the clear. This matter now appears worse than originally suspected as the dataset also contains a table where RockYou have stored user credentials for social networks and other partner sites.

The database consists of a table containing partner data, and another table that has stored the credentials for those partner sites that users have entered. This includes social networks such as MySpace but also webmail accounts.

The initial exploit took advantage of a trivial SQL injection vulnerability, a technique that has been well documented for over a decade. The method of vulnerability is extremely basic in execution, yet catastrophic in impact – which RockYou, and the sites users, are now learning the hard way. It is more of a surprise that this had not happen sooner – as the RockYou platform is a swiss cheese of security vulnerabilities and poor practices.

Where RockYou Went Wrong
Poor password policies

RockYou account creation only enforced password of a minimal length of 5 characters, there was no requirement for mixed-case, numbers or punctuation. The platform actually encouraged simple passwords by not allowing any punctuation at all.



Passwords in the clear

RockYou are still storing passwords in the clear, and transporting user passwords in the clear via email. Despite the attack taking place over 10 days ago now and RockYou knowing about the attack, a user signing up for a RockYou account today will still have their password stored as plain text and emailed to them in the clear.



The password anti-pattern

RockYou prompted users to enter their third-party site credentials directly into the RockYou site when sharing data or an application. The Facebook integration requires proper Facebook authentication, and MySpace  integration today applies similar techniques, but for most of the other sites the same old crazy password request form is still present. Telling your users that you will not store their password is not a solution.



Terrible Response

RockYou knew about the breach days ago, and it took a taunt from the hacker for the issue to become well-known and for RockYou to issue a response (although their users are still not aware of the issue, unless they are reading the news online).

The sites privacy policy and the related ‘security’ section state:

Our Commitment To Data Security:
RockYou! uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to RockYou! and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, RockYou! makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If RockYou! learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. RockYou! may post a notice on the RockYou! Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using this contact form.

Next time you sign up for a web service, take a moment to see where they stand on informing their users on a data breach, and find out just how much they respect the privacy of their users.

RockYou have been complacent with what is a very serious matter. They have not taken steps to rectify the problems that caused the breach and have not addressed their users in a suitable or adequate manner. An appropriate response would have been to take the site down for a period of a few hours and enforce that users enter new passwords, which would be stored in a hashed or encrypted form. The sad thing is that companies are able to get away with being so complacent, because most users will not find out about this, most users will never be affected by it and there is zero accountability for a users private data from service providers.

If you know of any company with similar policies, such as emailing passwords in the clear – call them out in the comments or email us on tips at beta.techcrunch.com. We will make sure that we followup with each of them, and call them out if necessary.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"43","CheckFree Corporation","5,000,000","2009","CheckFree warns 5 million customers after hack
It's not sure how many customers may have been exposed to malware
CheckFree Corp. and some of the banks that use its electronic bill payment service are notifying more than 5 million customers that criminals took control of several of the company's Internet domains and redirected customer traffic to a malicious Web site hosted in the Ukraine.

The Dec. 2 attack was widely publicized shortly after it occurred, but in a notice filed with the New Hampshire Attorney General, CheckFree disclosed that it was warning many more customers than previously thought.

That's because CheckFree is not only notifying users of its own CheckFree.com Web site of the breach, it is also working with banks to contact people who tried to pay bills from banks that use the CheckFree bill payment service.
""The 5 million people who were notified about the CheckFree redirection were a combination of two groups,"" said Melanie Tolley, vice president of communications at CheckFree's parent company, Fiserv Inc., in a statement. ""1.) those who we were able to identify who had attempted to pay bills from our client's bill pay sites and minus those who actually completed sessions on our site, and 2.) anyone enrolled in mycheckfree.com.""

Tolley wouldn't say what banks were affected by the hack, but the majority of these 5 million customers were CheckFree's own users, she said. In total, about 42 million customers access CheckFree's bill payment site, she said.

Customers who went to CheckFree's Web sites between 12:35 a.m. and 10:10 a.m. on the day of the attack were redirected to a Ukrainian Web server that used malicious software to try and install a password-stealing program on the victim's computer.

The criminals were able to take control of several CheckFree Web domains after logging into the company's Internet domain registrar, Network Solutions, and changing the CheckFree DNS settings. This same technique was used by hackers one year ago to take control of Comcast's Web site. It is not clear how the attackers were able to get CheckFree's Network Solutions password, but some security experts believe that CheckFree may have fallen prey to a phishing attack.
Looking at typical Web site traffic patterns, Fiserv guesses that about 160,000 consumers were exposed to the Ukrainian attack site, but not all of these customers would have been infected. For the attack to work, the victim would have to be a PC user without antivirus software who was also using an out-of-date version of Adobe Acrobat. Because of these conditions, Fiserv believes that ""a very small number"" of people were affected, Tolley said.

However, because the company lost control of its Web domains, it doesn't know exactly who was hit. And so it must warn a much larger number of customers.

It could have been much worse. CheckFree processes bill payments for more than half of the banking institutions in the U.S., according to Gartner Inc. analyst Avivah Litan.

Although larger banks typically do not do this, some smaller banks simply turn their online bill payment services over to CheckFree, she said. ""If they turn it over to CheckFree, chances are all those users were redirected to the CheckFree domain, but it was branded as the bank's domain.""

CheckFree has deals to provide electronic bill payment services to banks such as Wachovia and Bank of America. It is not clear whether or not these banks were affected by the attack.

This kind of incident could also happen with fund transfer services, which are also frequently outsourced, Litan said. ""Bank security is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest links in banking are online payment and fund transfer [services],"" Litan said.","financial","1",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Malware"

The malicious code left behind by the attackers allowed them to intercept personal and financial information for customers who purchased from those stores, Network Solutions spokeswoman Susan Wade said.

Wade said the company is working with federal law enforcement and a commercial data breach forensics team to determine the cause and source of the break-in. The payment data stolen was captured from transactions made between March 12, 2009 and June 8, 2009.

On Friday, Network Solutions began notifying affected customers by e-mail and postal mail. Due to the potential high cost of notifying individual victims, the hosting company is offering to handle the notification of affected customers of the breached online stores. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws requiring organizations to notify consumers when a data breach or loss jeopardizes the security of personal and financial data, but the rules for complying with those laws differ from state to state.

""We feel terribly about it to burden them with the notification process, which can be kind of tricky because there is no one federal data breach statute,"" Wade said.

Network Solutions also is offering to pay for 12 months of credit monitoring service through Trans Union for each consumer whose financial and personal data was compromised.","tech","3",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Malware"

An attack on the Virginia Department of Health Professionals (VDHP) website, resulted in a prescriptions website being hacked and a $10m ransom demand for the return of millions of allegedly stolen patient records.

US press reports and blogs say the attack involved over eight million electronic patient records and some 35m prescription records. That an attack had happened was confirmed by VDHP which immediately suspended all its servers.

According to an Information Week report, the alleged attack saw a hacker claim to download eight million patient records, erase the records from the VDGP servers, and then demand a $10m ransom for the return of the files.

The Wikileaks website reported that the Web site for the Virginia Prescription Monitoring Program had been defaced with a message claiming that the database of prescriptions had been bundled into an encrypted, password-protected file. VDHP says proper backups were in place.

According to a report by the Richmond Times Dispatch, on 31 April all 36 servers storing the state agency’s records were shut down after a midday message popped up on some computer screens that claimed the system was being hacked.

Sandra Whitley Ryals, director of the Virginia Department of Health, said in a 6 May statement. “A criminal investigation is currently underway regarding a potential security breach of the Virginia Department of Health Profession’s (DHP) Prescription Monitoring Program on Thursday, April 30.”
The statement continued: “The entire DHP system was shut down since Thursday to protect the security of the program data, and state authorities including the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) and the Virginia State Police were notified immediately upon identifying the potential breach. We are satisfied that all data was properly backed up and that these backup files have been secured.”

The claimed attack is the second to be reported by the Wall Street Journal in the past year. In October 2008, Express Scripts, a processor of pharmacy prescriptions, said extortionists were threatening to disclose the personal and medical information of millions of US citizens if the company failed to meet payment demands. Express Scripts is now said to be offering a $1m reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.","healthcare","2",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"46","Virginia Dept. Of Health","8,257,378","2009","Hackers Break Into Virginia Health Professions Database, Demand Ransom
Hackers last week broke into a Virginia state Web site used by pharmacists to track prescription drug abuse. They deleted records on more than 8 million patients and replaced the site's homepage with a ransom note demanding $10 million for the return of the records, according to a posting on Wikileaks.org, an online clearinghouse for leaked documents.

Wikileaks reports that the Web site for the Virginia Prescription Monitoring Program was defaced last week with a message claiming that the database of prescriptions had been bundled into an encrypted, password-protected file.

Wikileaks has published a copy of the ransom note left in place of the PMP home page, a message that claims the state of Virginia would need to pay the demand in order to gain access to a password needed to unlock those records:

""I have your [expletive] In *my* possession, right now, are 8,257,378 patient records and a total of 35,548,087 prescriptions. Also, I made an encrypted backup and deleted the original. Unfortunately for Virginia, their backups seem to have gone missing, too. Uhoh :(For $10 million, I will gladly send along the password.""

The site, along with a number of other Web pages related to Virginia Department of Health Professions, remains unreachable at this time. Sandra Whitley Ryals, director of Virginia's Department of Health Professions, declined to discuss details of the hacker's claims, and referred inquires to the FBI.

""There is a criminal investigation under way by federal and state authorities, and we take the information security very serious,"" she said.

A spokesman for the FBI declined to confirm or deny that the agency may be investigating.

Whitley Ryals said the state discovered the intrusion on April 30, after which time it shut down Web site site access to dozens of pages serving the Department of Health Professions. The state also has temporarily discontinued e-mail to and from the department pending the outcome of a security audit, Whitley Ryals said.

""We do have some of systems restored, but we're being very careful in working with experts and authorities to take essential steps as we proceed forward,"" she said. ""Only when the experts tell us that these systems are safe and secure for being live and interactive will that restoration be complete.""

She added that the department does have a page online at www.dhp.virginia.gov that lists the phone and fax numbers for various state health boards, and that the state would continue issuing health care licenses and investigating violations of the law or regulations of state health licensees.

This is the second major extortion attack related to the theft of health care data in the past year. In October 2008, Express Scripts, one of the nation's largest processors of pharmacy prescriptions, disclosed that extortionists were threatening to disclose personal and medical information on millions of Americans if the company failed to meet payment demands. Express Scripts is currently offering a $1 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual(s) responsible for trying to extort money from the company.","government","4",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Attackers access public health center Web site, then break into secured databases on the same server, stealing some 97,000 Social Security numbers.
Hackers broke into the University of California at Berkeley's health services center computer and potentially stole the personal information of more than 160,000 students, alumni, and others, the university announced Friday.

At particular risk of identity theft are some 97,000 individuals whose Social Security numbers were accessed in the breach, but it's still unclear whether hackers were able to match up those SSNs with individual names, Shelton Waggener, UCB's chief technology officer, said in a press conference Friday afternoon.
The attackers accessed a public Web site and then bypassed additional secured databases stored on the same server. In addition to SSNs, the databases contained health insurance information and non-treatment medical information, such as immunization records and names of doctors patients had seen. No medical records (i.e. patient diagnoses, treatments, and therapies) were taken, as they are stored in a separate system, emphasized Steve Lustig, associate vice chancellor for health and human services.

""Their ID has not been stolen,"" he added. ""Some data has been stolen.""

The server breach began on October 9, 2008, and continued through April 9, when a campus computer administrator doing routine maintenance discovered messages left by the attackers. Logs indicate that the hacks originated from overseas, ""primarily in the Asian theater,"" Waggener said, later specifying traces to China.

While campus police and the FBI were immediately notified of the breach, it wasn't until April 21, Waggener said, that officials learned data had been stolen. Since then, the focus of the investigation has been figuring out what was taken and who is at risk. The hackers' specific techniques are still being determined as part of the ongoing criminal investigation, he said.

From the looks of it, however, one outside database security software vendor, Sentrigo CTO Slavik Markovich, suspects an SQL injection, in which a small malicious script is inserted into a database that feeds information to the Web site. Markovich also questions whether the university has appropriate monitoring tools in place to have not noticed the hack for six months, and why it hosted data with different levels of sensitivity on the same server.

The university started notifying the 160,000 people at risk via e-mail and snail mail on Friday. Victims include an assortment of current and former Berkeley students--as well as their parents or spouses, if linked to insurance coverage--who had University Health Services health care coverage or received services. Also included are 3,400 students of Mills College in Oakland, Calif., which contracts with the university for health services.

The university has warned those affected to put a fraud alert on their credit reporting accounts. It has also set up a Web site and hotline to help the victims.

In 2005, a PC was stolen from a Berkeley graduate admission office that held sensitive data on some 98,000 people, stretching back three decades. And the university has dealt with security viruses and the like, Waggener said. But this was the first such server breach.

With this, Waggener said, Berkeley joins a long list of prestigious institutions suffering from such increasingly sophisticated and malicious attacks. ""We're defending against attacks from around the world,"" he said.","academic","3",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Connecticut A.G. calls six-month delay in reporting loss 'incomprehensible
A hard drive with seven years' worth of personal financial and medical information on about 1.5 million customers of Health Net of the Northeast Inc. was reported missing to state officials yesterday -- six months after the drive went missing.

Along with medical records, the hard drive contains names, addresses and Social Security numbers of Health Net customers from Arizona, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Connecticut has data breach laws requiring individuals be notified of the loss of their personal data without reasonable delay.

The data loss, which occurred in May, was only reported by the insurance company to the Connecticut state attorney general's office and the Department of Insurance yesterday. The device containing the data was an external, portable hard drive. The data had not been encrypted.
Health Net, based in Shelton, Conn., had no information about the data breach on its Web site.

Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his office is investigating the data breach. ""Health Net's incomprehensible foot-dragging demonstrates shocking disregard for patients' financial security, as well as loss of their highly sensitive and confidential personal health information,"" he said in a statement.

""I will demand immediate answers and action, including at least two years of comprehensive identity theft protection for consumers,"" he said. ""We will demand identity theft insurance and reimbursement for credit freezes as well as credit monitoring for at least two years for all 446,000 consumers"" in Connecticut whose data is at risk.

The state's insurance commissioner, Thomas Sullivan, said he is requiring Health Net to offer credit protection monitoring through Debix, a company that provides identity-theft protection services.
According to a statement by Health Net, the information on the drive was saved in an image format that cannot be read without special software. Health Net plans to send letters to its customers officially notifying them of the incident.

""Protecting the privacy of our members is extremely important to us,"" Health Net said. ""We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause our members.""

The company said that, to date, it has received no reports of misused data arising from the breach and pledged to provide credit monitoring for over two years ""free of charge to all impacted members who elect this service, and will provide assistance to any member who has experienced any suspicious activity, identity theft or health care fraud between May 2009 and their date of enrollment with our identity protection service.""

The inspector general of the National Archives and Records Administration is investigating a potential data breach affecting tens of millions of records about U.S. military veterans, Wired.com has learned. The issue involves a defective hard drive the agency sent back to its vendor for repair and recycling without first destroying the data.

The hard drive helped power eVetRecs, the system veterans use to request copies of their health records and discharge papers. When the drive failed in November of last year, the agency returned the drive to GMRI, the contractor that sold it to them, for repair. GMRI determined it couldn't be fixed, and ultimately passed it to another firm to be recycled.

The incident was reported to NARA's inspector general by Hank Bellomy, a NARA IT manager, who charges that the move put 70 million veterans at risk of identity theft, and that NARA's practice of returning hard drives unsanitized was symptomatic of an irresponsible security mindset unbecoming to America's record-keeping agency.

""This is the single largest release of personally identifiable information by the government ever,"" Bellomy told Wired.com. ""When the USDA did the same thing, they provided credit monitoring for all their employees. We leaked 70 million records, and no one has heard a word of it.""

But NARA says the lost drive is not a problem because its contractors signed privacy promises in their contracts, though the agency has since changed its policy to require that sensitive media be destroyed by NARA itself.

The drive was part of a RAID array of six drives containing an Oracle database that held detailed records on 76 million veterans, including millions of Social Security numbers dating to 1972, when the military began using individuals' Social Security numbers as their service numbers.

When the unencrypted drive failed, Bellomy says he tried to subvert the longstanding recycling policy by hiding the drive in his safe. But it was taken out of his control when he was put on long-term leave. Under the conditions of the maintenance contract, if NARA did not return the drive, GMRI would have billed the agency $2,000 for a replacement.

He adds that more drives failed after the November incident, and that he performed a forensic scan on them to prove that they were full of sensitive data.

""I said you can't turn them back in. The data is Privacy Act – it's against the law,"" Bellomy told Wired.com. ""We have no clue how many drives have been sent back over the past seven years since this system was in place. I am a government employee and I'm a veteran, and just this year had both my credit cards replaced because they were compromised.""

The Pentagon requires that old drives be degaussed (de-magnified) or physicall destroyed. In a 2006 report still in effect, the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommended purging and destruction methods (.pdf), while OMB rules (.pdf) dating to the same year require that agencies follow those NIST standards and encrypt sensitive data being sent or stored remotely.

But NARA says that while it no longer will send back drives, no rules were broken, and that warning veterans would cause unnecessary fear.

""NARA does not believe that a breach of PII (personally identifiable information) occurred, and therefore does not believe that notification is necessary or appropriate at this time,"" NARA told Wired.com in an e-mailed background paper (pdf). ""This view could change if the [inspector general] investigation of this incident later determines that GMRI ... or their subcontractors took some illegal or unethical action that may have compromised sensitive data contained on the inoperable November 2008 disk drive.""

As part of a six disk RAID 5 set-up, the drive likely contained about 18 percent of the database, and the disk also likely contained a quick look-up table that included all veterans' names and service-record numbers, according to Bellomy.

US-CERT, the nation's clearinghouse for data breaches and hacks, was notified in February by a NARA employee named Thomas Bennett, according to a document (.pdf) Bellomy provided to Wired.com.

""The information system contains a significant amount of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive PII about veterans,"" wrote Thomas Bennett, a NARA employee. ""As a result, we believe that is likely that the defective drive contains PII and SPII. At this time, we are trying to determine the location and status of the drive.""

The status of the NARA investigation is unclear, though the incident was alluded to in a recent report on the inspector general's activity.

""We are aware of the incidents and are looking into it,"" said Ross Weiland, the assistant inspector general for investigations at NARA . He declined further comment.

This isn't the first time that veteran's data has been lost or that NARA has been investigated for controversial data-handling practices.

The Veteran's Administration lost a laptop containing personal records on more than 25 million veterans in 2005 and, earlier this year, settled a class action suit over the breach by paying out $20 million.

NARA recently lost a hard drive full of data from the Clinton White House, including 100,000 Social Security numbers, political records and event logs. The data has still not been located.

Both the House Oversight Committee for Veterans Affairs and an oversight committee for NARA were notified of the lost drive, but neither committee returned calls seeking comment.

In the wake of an information breach affecting nearly 1 million people, executives at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee have many lessons to share and plenty of advice to offer.

On Oct. 2, 2009, someone stole 57 unencrypted hard drives from servers at a call center the insurer had recently closed. So far, there have been no arrests, nor any evidence of fraud committed, the company reports.

[…]
Among the actions the Tennessee plan has taken and the lessons it has learned are:

Adding a layer of physical security to protect servers is a prudent step.
Encryption should be applied widely, including on servers.
Appointing a chief security officer helps to ensure coordination of all security efforts.
Organizations should carefully assess how long to store information.
In preparing a breach notification plan, be sure to prepare a pre-selected list of vendors that can help with various tasks.
Train customer service representatives to deal with breach-related questions from the public.
Communicate frequent updates on breach investigations through the media and a Web site.
Read more on HealthInfoSecurity.com.  Interestingly, one of the lessons that I think everyone should have learned from this incident is not included in their list:  think about recording calls for quality assurance purposes and ensure you have a way to retrieve PII and PHI if need be — and securely destroy such data on a frequent and regular basis.   BCBS spent extraordinary time trying to figure out what was on the audio tapes.   Of course, if strong encryption is used, some of that might not be necessary.","healthcare","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

The WikiLeaks embassy cables release has produced a lot of stories but does it produce any useful data? We explain what it includes and how it breaks down - plus you can download the key data for every cable
Remember this is the date, time, sender and tags for each cable - NOT the text of the cable itself

WikiLeaks embassy cables revelations cover a huge dataset of official documents: 251,287 dispatches, from more than 250 worldwide US embassies and consulates. It's a unique picture of US diplomatic language - including over 50,000 documents covering the current Obama administration. But what does the data include?
The cables themselves come via the huge Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet. SIPRNet is the worldwide US military internet system, kept separate from the ordinary civilian internet and run by the Department of Defense in Washington. Since the attacks of September 2001, there has been a move in the US to link up archives of government information, in the hope that key intelligence no longer gets trapped in information silos or ""stovepipes"". An increasing number of US embassies have become linked to SIPRNet over the past decade, so that military and diplomatic information can be shared. By 2002, 125 embassies were on SIPRNet: by 2005, the number had risen to 180, and by now the vast majority of US missions worldwide are linked to the system - which is why the bulk of these cables are from 2008 and 2009.
An embassy dispatch marked SIPDIS is automatically downloaded on to its embassy classified website. From there, it can be accessed not only by anyone in the state department, but also by anyone in the US military who has a security clearance up to the 'Secret' level, a password, and a computer connected to SIPRNet - which astonishingly covers over 3m people. There are several layers of data in here - ranging up to the ""SECRET NOFORN"" level, which means that they are designed never be shown to non-US citizens. Instead, they are supposed to be read by officials in Washington up to the level of current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The cables are normally drafted by the local ambassador or subordinates. The ""Top Secret"" and above foreign intelligence documents cannot be accessed from SIPRNet.

 This article is more than 8 years old
Quarter of a million passwords published and Twitter feed used to taunt 'arrogant' management in audacious security breach
Over the past week several big corporations, from MasterCard and Visa to PayPal and Amazon, have come under attack from loosely co-ordinated networks of hackers operating in support of WikiLeaks under the codename of Anonymous. But over the weekend a new kind of victim fell foul of the hackers' attentions – the hyper-fashionable, super-tech-savvy Gawker websites.

The 24-hour attack penetrated deep into Gawker's computer systems, shattering its security shield and catching its executives off guard.

The hackers cracked more than a quarter of a million passwords in the website's database, dumping the information on the internet, where it could easily be found – including the personal details of Gawker's British founder and mastermind, Nick Denton.
""We understand how important trust is on the internet, and we're deeply sorry for and embarrassed about this breach of security – and of trust,"" a contrite Gawker management said, admitting that the integrity of all its nine sites had been compromised.

Within hours of the attack being launched on Saturday the assailants had gained access to Gawker's database of usernames and passwords as well as the programs that are used to serve up the sites, known as their source code. The first sign of the attack was a tweet posted to the Twitter account of the Gawker gadget site, Gizmodo, which said ""Support WikiLeaks"" and added ""Gawker.com hacked, 1.5 million usernames/emails/passwords taken.""

The use of Gawker's own Twitter feed by the hackers to announce their ploy was a breathtaking act of defiance.

Even more audaciously, they then went on to post real-time email exchanges between Gawker staffers that they had hacked into, in which the employees discussed how they were coming under attack.

The attack took the recent flurry of mass hacking escapades into new territory. Previous corporate targets such as PayPal and MasterCard have been selected for their failure to support WikiLeaks as part of the so-called Operation Payback launched by fans of the whistleblower site.
Gawker by contrast has had no special involvement in the WikiLeaks events and appears to have been singled out more for its past tussles with the hacking fraternity than for anything to do with its reporting of the embassy cables.

The cyber attack was claimed by a previously unknown group of hackers going by the name of Gnosis.

In an email exchange with the website Mediaite, one of its members said it had attacked Gawker because it wanted to expose the ""outright arrogance"" of Gawker's management by highlighting the site's inadequate security. ""Gawkmedia has possibly the worst security I have ever seen. It is scary how poor it is,"" the correspondent said. The complaint of arrogance appears to have been a reference to a feud that has been running for more than a year between Gawker and 4Chan, an image board frequently used by hackers, including those who orchestrated the Anonymous pro-WikiLeaks attacks over the past 10 days.

A sub-board on 4Chan, known as /b/, acts as a meeting house for some of the most dedicated hackers.

Among its many actions was the memorable prank in which it hijacked an internet poll asking fans of the teenage pop star Justin Bieber to decide which country he should tour next. 4Chaners latched on to the vote and swamped it, pushing North Korea into prime position.

The image board has been the subject of regular posts on Gawker written in the site's trademark snarky and forthright style. Gawker has called 4Chan the ""ground zero for internet mischief"", ""[home of] the internet's worst trolls"", and likened the experience of reading it to consuming ""heroin mixed with fibreglass"".

Last July, Gawker accused the wholly anonymous frequenters of 4Chan of hounding an 11-year-old girl so ferociously that she required police protection.

Within hours 4Chan hit back, organising a group attack on Gawker that succeeded in slowing, though not bringing down, the site.

Gawker writer Ryan Tate in turn ramped up the war by calling their assailants ""script kiddies"", ridiculing them as ""3Chan"" and goading them with the combative words: ""The best response to dumb young guys trying to intimidate their enemies online is to refuse to be intimidated. If any of you sad 4chaners have a problem with that, you know how to reach me.""

It took five months but it seems that the ""sad 4chaners"" have now indeed reached Gawker, with a vengeance. Though the Gnosis correspondent denied any formal link with 4Chan, it is clear that Gawker's sustained and critical coverage of the image board was an important motive for the cyber attack.

In the 500MB file the hackers placed on the file-sharing system BitTorrent, containing the information hacked out of Gawker's database, the attackers left a clear reference to Denton's earlier challenge. They wrote: ""Hows this for 'script kids?' Your empire has been compromised … You wanted attention, well guess what, You've got it now!""

The attackers also posted snippets from email exchanges between Gawker staff reporters that they stole, having broken into Gawker's private back channel. Several of the emails referred to 4Chan, with Gawker staffers composing joke headlines such as ""Suck on This, 4Chan"", ""We Are Not Scared of 4chan Here"" and ""Nick Denton Says Bring It On 4Chan"".

In the wake of the attack, Gawker has brought in an independent security company to vamp up its protection. Denton is keeping uncharacteristically silent about 4Chan, though nobody expects his restraint to last for long.","tech","2",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

The Puerto Rico Department of Health has reported a security breach to HHS involving Triple-S Management and Corp. and Triple-S Salud, Inc. Triple-S Management is a managed care company while Triple-S Salud (Triple Health) is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for Puerto Rico.  The breach was reported to HHS as affecting 400,000, and was coded by HHS as “Unauthorized Access/Disclosure, Hacking/IT Incident” involving the “Network Server.” According to HHS’s logs, the breach reportedly occurred on Sept. 21.

I did some digging and found this notice on Triple-S Salud’s site:



If I’m translating it correctly, they are informing people that one or more employees of Medical Card System (illegally) accessed restricted areas of their web site until September 30 and that the breach affected people enrolled in the health plan of the Puerto Rican government for the North and North-Metro regions. The information accessed included the following types of subscriber information: subscriber name, address, diagnostic codes, procedure codes, and IPA (independent practice association).

Not trusting my rusty Spanish skills, however, I decided to keep digging. I found this as part of a Triple-S Management’s 10-Q securities filing:

Intrusions into Triple-C, Inc. Internet IPA Database

On September 21, 2010, we learned from a competitor that a specific internet database managed by our subsidiary TCI [Triple-C, Inc.], containing information pertaining to individuals previously insured by TSS [Triple-S Salud, Inc.] under the Government of Puerto Rico’s Health Insurance Plan (“HIP”) and to independent practice associations (“IPAs”) that provided services to those individuals, had been accessed without authorization by certain of our competitor’s employees from September 9 to September 15, 2010. We immediately began an investigation and engaged external resources to assist in this matter. TCI served as a third-party administrator for TSS in the administration of its HIP contracts until September 30, 2010. We have identified the information that was accessed and downloaded into the competitor’s system. The September 2010 intrusions may have potentially compromised protected health information of approximately 398,000 beneficiaries in the North and Metro-North regions of the HIP. We have also learned as a result of our ongoing investigation that protected health information of approximately 5,500 HIP beneficiaries, 2,500 Medicare beneficiaries and IPA data from all three HIP regions previously serviced by TSS was accessed through multiple, separate intrusions into the TCI IPA database from October 2008 to August 2010. The stolen information did not include Social Security numbers.

Our investigation has revealed that the security breaches were the result of unauthorized use of one or more active user IDs and passwords specific to the TCI IPA database, and not the result of breaches of TSS’s or the Corporation’s system security features. We cannot at this time determine the purpose of these breaches and do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of the information or its impact on the potentially affected individuals and IPAs. We believe, however, that the most likely target was financial information related to IPAs rather than the individuals’ information. During the course of our investigation we learned that there may have been improper uses of the IPA passwords by one or more consultants working for the IPAs. We have taken measures to strengthen the TCI server security and credentials management procedures, and are conducting an assessment of our system-wide data and facility security to prevent the occurrence of a similar incident in the future. We continue to investigate these events and to analyze the data as it becomes known to us to identify all individuals and entities whose information may have been impacted, and to take any additional corresponding remedial actions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

We have notified the appropriate Puerto Rico and federal government agencies of these events, and have issued public notice of the breaches as required under Puerto Rico law. We have received a number of inquiries and requests for information related to these events from these government agencies and are cooperating with them. As a result of our ongoing investigation, we have determined that additional filings and public notices will be required. In addition, the Puerto Rico government agency that oversees the HIP has levied a fine of $100,000 on TSS in connection with these incidents, which we are appealing. Other government agencies may seek to impose fines or other obligations on us. We do not have sufficient information at this time to predict whether any future action by government entities or others as a result of the data breaches would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Ohio State revealed a data breach Wednesday that has jeopardized the identities of 760,000 people and could cost the university $4 million.

The university notified current and former faculty, students, applicants and others affiliated with the university that hackers had accessed the server that stored their names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and addresses.

“We regret that this has occurred and are exercising an abundance of caution in choosing to notify those affected,” said OSU Provost Joseph A. Alutto in a press release Wednesday.

Though the university said there’s no evidence data were stolen, computer privacy experts cautioned that the breach could result in identity theft of the individuals whose information is stored on the server.

“Unless proven otherwise, when information like that becomes exposed, there always is a potential for identity theft,” said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy for Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a San Diego-based nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

The university is offering 12 months of free credit protection to everyone whose information was on the server through Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.

The breach will cost the university $4 million in expenses related to investigative consulting, notification of the breach, credit security and a calling center for anyone with questions or concerns.

OSU officials said every current and former student, faculty and staff member was sent an e-mail Wednesday informing them of the data breach and precautions the university is taking in its aftermath.

OSU spokesman Jim Lynch said the time delay between the discovery of the breach in October and notification of it Wednesday was necessary to research and prepare for solutions to the problem.

“The last thing we want to do is announce something and not have support systems set up,” Lynch said. “It wouldn’t have been wise to put it out any sooner.”

In that time, the university hired two computer security consulting firms, Interhack Corp., based in Columbus, and Stroz Friedberg LLC, based in New York. These firms determined in November that there was no evidence indicating that hackers took information out of the server.

The university cannot disclose how hackers accessed the server for security reasons and because the incident is still under investigation.

Stephens said that improved security could have prevented the situation. OSU is seeking to strengthen its IT systems with the help of Interhack and Stroz Friedberg.

They are “looking to analyze how we can enhance our security,” Lynch said.

The university is unable to determine who hacked the system, but OSU Police are investigating the incident.

There have been 68 breaches of educational institutions in 2010, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. The OSU breach affected the most records, with the next highest being the possible unauthorized access to 232,000 records at Houston Independent School District in Houston on Oct. 27.

OSU has had several data breaches in the past.

The Lantern reported on April 18, 2007, that 14,000 people were notified as a result of criminal intrusion into a database in the university’s Office of Research. In February of that year, two laptops containing an additional 3,500 chemistry students’ information were stolen.

The university notified 18,000 current and former students on Dec. 31, 2008, that their personal information was stored on a server that was exposed on the Internet.

On June 6, 2009, 350 OSU Dining Services student employees had their Social Security numbers leaked in an e-mail.

This is more than the average number of data breaches for an institution, Stephens said, adding that the recent breach of 760,000 records is considered very large.

“I guess in the age when we have WikiLeaks and whatnot, it shouldn’t be too surprising,” said Jeanette Pavlik, a fourth-year in communication.

Pavlik said she was surprised, however, that the university didn’t have greater security in place.

Interhack declined to comment, and Stroz Friedberg did not immediately return phone calls.

"57","AT&T","114,000","2010","Security leak leaves US Apple iPad owners at risk
Email addresses obtained by hackers after a breach of AT&T website
The White House chief of staff is believed to be among 114,000 iPad owners, including chief executives and military officials, whose personal details have been exposed through a breach of the website of the US phone network AT&T.

AT&T acknowledged the leak but said the risk was limited to the subscriber's email address and that the issue had been ""escalated to the highest levels of the company"". UK customers are not thought to have been affected or to be vulnerable to the same attack.

The names and email addresses of those involved apparently includes Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, members of the US Senate and House of Representatives, staff at Nasa and the department of homeland security, the New York Times, Viacom, Time Warner, bankers and venture capitalists.
It will be an embarrassment to Apple, which has sold more than 2m of the tablet computers since they went on sale in the US at the start of April, and late last month internationally. The iPad comes in two main versions, one with 3G and one without. The news that the 3G version could have been liable to hacking could depress sales of the more profitable version. It will also increase friction between Apple and AT&T, which has had the exclusive rights to sell the iPhone since 2007, and now the 3G-enabled iPad in the US. The exclusivity is believed to be a five-year deal but many Apple fans have accused AT&T's network of being unable to support their growing demand for bandwidth.

The Gawker website, which says it has seen details of the email addresses – provided in a foot-high printout – suggests that the flaw makes any of those people vulnerable to spam marketing and malicious hacking. The breach was demonstrated by a team of hackers calling themselves Goatse Security, who have previously pointed to weaknesses in web browsers. They were able to use a flaw in the AT&T website to get the email address of any AT&T subscriber by providing a piece of data called an ICC-IDS, used to identify the SIM card belonging to that subscriber.

The team sent data to the site pretending to be each of a huge sequence of ICC-IDS devices, and requested the email address. They say they also shared the knowledge of the hack with others, until AT&T closed the breach a few days ago.

An AT&T spokesman said: ""AT&T was informed by a business customer on Monday of the potential exposure of their iPad ICC-IDS. The only information that can be derived from the ICC-IDS is the e-mail address attached to that device. This issue was escalated to the highest levels of the company and was corrected by Tuesday; and we have essentially turned off the feature [on the website] that provided the e-mail addresses.

""The person or group who discovered this gap did not contact AT&T. We are continuing to investigate and will inform all customers whose e-mail addresses and ICC-IDS may have been obtained.""

""We take customer privacy very seriously and while we have fixed this problem, we apologise to our customers who were impacted.""

Apple did not have any statement.

If the hackers have discovered a flaw that was widespread in AT&T's handling of the ICC-ID system, then it is possible that every owner in the US with an iPhone 3GS or a 3G iPad may have had their email address lifted by the group, and possibly others.

Only iPads which use 3G networking would be vulnerable to the hack, and although any device which uses a SIM will have an ICC-ID, it is not known whether the British networks which provide connectivity for the iPad would have the same flaw as AT&T's website.

Company and federal officials said they believed last week's theft of identity data on 3.3 million people with student loans was the largest-ever breach of such information and could affect as many as 5% of all federal student-loan borrowers.

Names, addresses, Social Security numbers and other personal data on borrowers were stolen from the St. Paul, Minn., headquarters of Educational Credit Management Corp., a nonprofit guarantor of federal student loans, during the weekend of March 20-21, according to the company.

ECMC said the stolen information was on a portable media device. ""It was simple, old-fashioned theft,"" said ECMC spokesman Paul Kelash. ""It was not a hacker incident.""

Citing state and federal criminal investigations, ECMC has released only limited information about the theft since posting a notice on its Web site Friday. It plans to notify affected customers in writing this week.

David Hawn, ECMC's chief business-development officer, said the company didn't believe the data theft was connected with last week's enactment of the largest overhaul of federal student-loan rules in decades. Details are being worked out on how the new law will be implemented, and ECMC said it was still evaluating how the legislation would affect it.

The ECMC incident is the latest in a series of thefts of consumers' financial data in recent years. Earlier this month, a former employee of HSBC Holdings PLC allegedly stole data on about 24,000 Swiss private-bank accounts. In 2005, 40 million accounts serviced by payment processor CardSystems were compromised. In 2007, TJX Co., the company that owns retailer T.J. Maxx, disclosed that 45 million credit- and debit-card account numbers had been breached.

All told, more than 347 million records containing sensitive information have been compromised in the U.S. since 2005, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer group.

The student-loan market has battled data losses before. In 2006, 1.7 million computer records held by Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corp. were breached, while the U.S. Department of Education said a bug in its Web site compromised data on 21,000 people.

ECMC's St. Paul headquarters has card-key access for the 320 employees who work there, Mr. Hawn said. He said the company was reviewing its security.

ECMC services and insures more than $11 billion in student loans for the U.S. Department of Education. ECMC also owns Premiere Credit LLC, a federal student-loan collection agency. No Premiere accounts were affected by the theft, Mr. Hawn said.

Federal student-loan guarantors such as ECMC, USA Funds and American Student Assistance have contracts with the federal government to insure student loans against default. Some guarantors also originate student loans, although ECMC does not.

ECMC is the designated guarantor for loans in Oregon, Virginia and Connecticut, but borrowers from all states could be affected.

The 3.3 million social security numbers that were stolen from ECMC represent 8.9 million loans, Mr. Kelash said. One borrower may take out multiple loans.

""We are working with ECMC to make sure that affected individuals are provided with resources to protect their information and to provide with them with identity-theft insurance,"" said U.S. Department of Education spokesman Justin Hamilton.","financial","2",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Intentional_Data_Leak"

Malaysian Caught with 400K Stolen Cards
A 32-year-old Malaysian man was arrested shortly after his arrival last month at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City. His crime? Authorities say he hacked into the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank and several other computer systems, including a defense contractor.
Lin Mun Poo, a Malaysian national, faces a four-count indictment that charges him with hacking into computer systems and the possession of more than 400,000 stolen credit and debit card numbers.

""Cybercriminals continue to use their sophistication and skill as hackers to attack our financial and national security sectors,"" says Loretta Lynch, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Poo's arrest comes just a month after authorities arrested a big cyber crime gang in the U.S. and Europe for similar crimes.

When he arrived in New York on Oct. 21, he was arrested hours later by Secret Service agents. Poo, who is being held in pre-trial detention, ""made a career of compromising computer servers belonging to financial institutions, defense contractors and major corporations, among others, and selling or trading the information,"" says Lynch.

'Massive Quantity' of Stolen Data
Before his arrest, Poo had planned to get additional stolen financial account information from other hackers. authorities say. When Secret Service agents seized his heavily encrypted laptop, they found it contained ""a massive quantity"" of financial account data and personal identifying information that Poo had allegedly obtained by hacking into computer systems.
The list of victims includes FedComp, a data processor for federal credit unions. With access to FedComp's computers, Poo had unauthorized access to the data of federal credit unions, including the Firemen's Association of the State of New York and the Mercer County New Jersey Teachers. Poo also is charged with breaking into computer servers of a number of major financial institutions and companies, including a computer network of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, by exploiting a security vulnerability. The bank states Poo only broke into a test computer system and didn't access any sensitive information.

Security expert Avivah Litan, an analyst at Gartner, says while it isn't clear how Poo got in to the Federal Reserve's system, this hack ""highlights the need for PCI enforcement at banks, including government banks -- not just at merchants and payment processors."" She points out banks have always ""wiggled out"" of formal PCI data security enforcement and audits. ""Merchants have been complaining about this lopsided effort for years,"" Litan says.

Defense Contractor Hacked
Poo's cybercrime spree, according to authorities, extended to the national security sector. Court filings show that in August 2010 he allegedly hacked into the computer system of a Department of Defense contractor that provides systems management for military transport and other operations, potentially compromising highly sensitive military logistics information.

In the biggest document dump in Wikileaks' short history and possibly the biggest breach of classified data ever, the whistle-blower organization has posted 391,832 classified Iraq War documents on its website.


You can read them here.

Practically every major news organization in the world has been given 10 weeks of access to the documents prior to their release, and you can find some of their analyses via these links: CNN, the BBC, Al Jazeera (which broke Wikileaks' carefully negotiated embargo on the news), The New York Times, The Guardian, Der Spiegel, and Le Monde.

But as in the case of Wikileaks' massive Afghanistan document release, the site isn't depending on the media to publicize the documents. Instead, a site it's calling ""Diary Dig"" gives users access to a searchable database of every incident in the last six years of the war by period or region. Another site, called the ""War Logs"" and hosted in France, allows users to browse the documents, rate them for relevancy or interest, and post comments on them.

Regardless of the repercussions for U.S. Armed Forces and political leaders that will come out of this sudden dose of involuntary transparency, the leak should serve as another reminder for the information security community: Chinese cyberspies or Eastern European cybercriminals may threaten your data.

"61","Puerto Rico Department of Health","515,000","2010","Year End 2010: Healthcare Breach Synopsis

One of the healthcare IT hallmarks of the last 2 years has been the increase in regulatory reporting requirements for healthcare providers, not only because of the 2009 HITECH act, but also because of jurisdictional reasons (FTC reporting versus HHS reporting) and reporting at the state and local level.  In fact, just a glance at the regulations (timing, trip points, how to report) makes one realize how complex it has become, and how easy it is to inadvertently run afoul of compliance dictum.  Ahh… but that is for another rant… err..blog post.

One of the advantages to this trend is the increase in publicly available information.  One such source is the HHS website for healthcare breaches affecting over 500 individuals.  This post is meant to be a random walk through that data, highlighting some interesting numbers and correlations.  The source can be found here:  http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html .

First a few disclaimers. 

This is a blog post. It is entirely my opinion and observations, has not been peer reviewed, and is the result of about a 1/2 hours worth of analysis of the facts as delivered by the Federal Government and the self reporting of affected entities.  The numbers, since the self reporting data is messy, reflects some overlap and interpretation of the data.  In fact, the downloadable file from the HHS website does not match the browsable format – with a discrepancy of at least 15 entries.  That said, the data is still very interesting.

In summary, there were 155 reported breaches in 2010  (again, affecting 500 or more individuals).  The last reported entry was 11/9 – so more is most certainly on the way (I’ll update this post as they come in during 2011).

2,904,579 individuals impacted (about 1% of the US population).  A phenomenal amount, given this is first year data in a rapidly changing field.

WHERE: BY STATE
Not surprisingly, the larger population states had the most breaches reported (by number):

New York with 15, and California and Texas with 13 breaches each.

Surprisingly, some of the lower populated  regions did make a showing:  Kentucky with 7, and DC with 3, stood out.

NY	15
TX	13
CA	13
IL	9
MA	7
KY	7
OH	6
CT	6
TN	5
PA	5
WHAT: BY HARDWARE
Surprise!  (or not).  Paper breaches challenged laptops for dominance in terms of type of breach media. Email oriented breaches came in low – but I am sure reflects the lack of use (ostensibly for HIPAA and other reasons) of email as a healthcare medium.  Notably “EMRs” were highlighted by some reporting entities as the breach source.  The broader moniker of “Personal Electronic Devices” may include handhelds/palm/pad devices.

46 Laptops
39 Paper
26 Desktops
23 Personal Electronic Devices
13 Servers
5 Emails
2 EMR

HOW: BY MODUS OPERANDI
Thefts came out on top.  Inadvertent loss vied with unauthorized access (ala wikileaks) – emphasizing how far we need to go on identity and access management.  Note, too, the lack of dominance of hacking.  BTW – Hacking was, in some cases, lumped with “IT incident” – a dubious term at best.

HALLS OF SHAME: BY STATE
Finally, what I’ll call the Halls of Shame.  I’ve summarized breach numbers in terms of individuals affected, by state.  Sure, New York has the most reported number, but Massachusetts has by far the most, due in large part to one high profile breach.  Puerto Rico is a similar story (and #2 in our state ranked Halls of Shame).

HALLS OF SHAME: BY COVERED ENTITY
The chart below is directly from the HHS database.  Note how many third  party entities are involved in breaches (especially in the top 6, by individuals affected).  Possibly this reflects that breaches are more likely reported when there is a quasi check/balance due to two entities in the chain of custody.  Or the dispersion of responsibility connotes increased risk.  You decide.  Interestingly enough, one entry reflects finger pointing within  a state entity across state agencies.

Largest Incident Reported So Far Under HITECH Rule
Some 1.7 million individuals are being notified of a health information breach incident involving data from The New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. It's the largest breach reported so far under the HITECH Act breach notification rule, which went into effect in September 2009.
Computer backup tapes from the New York provider were stolen on Dec. 23, 2010, from a truck that was transporting them to a secure storage location, according to a website statement from the NYC organization and its letter to those affected. The unencrypted tapes included information on patients and hospital staff from the North Bronx Healthcare Network, a unit of the NYC Health and Hospitals Corp. That network includes Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, Tremont Health Center and Gunhill Health Center. Also on the tapes was information the hospitals' occupational health services collected about employees of vendors and contractors.
The information lost, which was collected during the past 20 years, includes: names, addresses, Social Security numbers, patient medical histories and the occupational/employee health information of staff, vendors, contractors and others, according to the statement.

All those affected are being offered one year of free credit protection services.

Breach Incident Details
The tapes were stolen from a truck operated by GRM Information Management Services while the files were being transported to a secure storage location, according to the provider organization. ""The incident was reported by GRM to both North Bronx officials and the police the same day, and an investigation was launched immediately,"" the letter to those affected stated. ""To date, these tapes have not been recovered.""
In its website statement, the organization noted, ""The theft occurred while the GRM van was left unattended and unlocked while the driver made other pickups. GRM reported the incident to the police and dismissed the driver of the vehicle.""

The statement also noted: ""The data in the stolen files is not readily accessible without highly specialized technical expertise and data mining tools, and there is no evidence to indicate that the information has been accessed and misused.""

NYC Health and Hospitals said the loss of the data ""occurred through the negligence of a contracted firm that specialized in the secure transport and storage of sensitive data, but HHC is taking responsibility for providing information and credit monitoring services to any affected individual who may be worried about the possibility of identity theft.""
Breach Prevention Steps
The provider organization said it has ""taken immediate measures to prevent a similar situation from reoccurring; has terminated the contract with the vendor responsible for the loss; and has filed a lawsuit against the vendor to hold it responsible for covering all of the costs associated with notifying all affected individuals and to pay for other damages related to the loss of the data.""
A spokesman for NYC Health and Hospitals told HealthcareInfoSecurity that while the organization has encrypted most of its backup files, the tapes that were stolen, unfortunately, had not yet been encrypted.

""HHC has been undergoing a multi-year data center consolidation project, which requires the careful transition and transfer of all data backup systems to the new center for storage,"" the spokesman said. ""As part of this process, HHC had to standardize data systems across the hospitals and encrypt all clinical systems backups. HHC has already encrypted more than 80 percent of the data. The Jacobi and NCB hospital system files were scheduled for the necessary migration and encryption in March 2011.""
Despite the lack of encryption, the stolen files will be difficult to decipher, the spokesman contended. ""Although the data were not encrypted, it exists in a proprietary program that scrambles the records and would make it difficult for individuals without specialized technical expertise and access to the right software and computer hardware to view the private information.""

As a result of the breach incident, the organization has suspended the transport of unencrypted backup files to off-site storage ""and will expedite its plan to upgrade critical data to the 256-bit advanced encryption standard, considered by the federal government as the highest level of protection against tampering,"" the spokesman said. ""At the time of the theft, HHC had already upgraded and encrypted nearly 80 percent of the 1,568 systems applications used throughout the corporation. The upgrade is expected to be completed by the fall of 2011.""
The spokesman also said the organization will hire a new vendor to handle offsite backup data, which will be ""stored in highly protected facilities that have climate-controlled, dedicated tape vaults, secure keycard access, video surveillance and trained personnel.""

Thefts Lead to Breaches
All of the three largest health information breaches reported so far under the HITECH Act breach notification rule have involved thefts.
The other two largest breaches reported to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights are:

An incident at AvMed Health Plan, which alerted more than 1.2 million about a breach related to the theft of a laptop.
An incident at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which informed nearly 1 million individuals about a breach stemming from the theft of 57 hard drives from a closed call center.","healthcare","4",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

ROCHESTER — Computer gamers hacked a server at Seacoast Radiology in Rochester in search of more bandwidth in November.

In the process they also gained access to personal records of the more than 230,000 patients of the health center.

Lisa MacKenzie, spokeswoman for ID Experts, the company brought on to secure the server, said the gamers accessed the server to play “Call of Duty: Black Ops,” a first-person shooter that can be played online.

Information technology workers discovered bandwidth was being siphoned from the server on Nov. 12 and immediately removed its Internet access.

In a letter dated Jan. 11, Seacoast Radiology informed its patients of the access.

“Thorough investigation has indicated that some of your personal information, including your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, medical codes, diagnosis codes and limited billing information was contained on this server,” the letter states. “No radiology reports, radiographic images, or other medical reports were stored on this server.”

The letter also states that no financial information was accessed.

“Please also note that no bank account or credit card information was involved in this incident,” reads the letter.

The letter was sent out last week following an investigation into the cause of the security breach and a determination that no information had been removed.

MacKenzie said Seacoast Radiology has since improved its security measures.

“There’s really no indication by the investigation that any of this information has been compromised,” she said.

ID Experts has set up a website, www.seacoastprivacy.com, on behalf of Seacoast Radiology to provide more information to patients.","healthcare","2",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

Firms increasingly targets for hackers, Coakley warns
Attorney General Martha Coakley said companies must do more to protect the personal data in their files.
Personal information from nearly one out of three Massachusetts residents, from names and addresses to medical histories, has been compromised through data theft or loss since the beginning of 2010, according to statistics released yesterday by the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley.

A state law enacted in 2007 requires all companies doing business in Massachusetts to inform consumers and state regulators about security breaches that might result in identity theft. That could include leaks of individual names along with other sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or bank account, credit card, and debit card numbers. The law was passed in 2007, after hackers stole 45 million credit card numbers from Framingham-based retailer TJX Cos.

Coakley said that her office is just beginning to analyze the reports to find out whether the law is helping to reduce data breaches. But she predicted the problem will get worse as more Americans store vital personal data on various computer networks. “There is going to be more room for employee error, for intentional hacking,’’ Coakley said. “This is going to be an increasing target.’’

The attorney general’s office has received 1,166 data breach notices since January 2010, including 480 between January and August of 2011. About 2.1 million residents were affected by the various incidents, though it’s unknown whether any of them were actually defrauded as a result of the data leaks.

Of the reported incidents, 25 percent involved deliberate hacking of computer systems containing sensitive data. Another 23 percent involved accidental sharing of information with unauthorized people, such as sending faxes or e-mails with personal information to the wrong recipient. In 15 percent of cases, retailers reported the theft of customer credit card numbers. Data was also lost through thefts or accidental losses of laptop computers and paper documents, or in cases in which workers deliberately gained unauthorized access to client files.

The biggest single data breach in the report occurred last July, when South Shore Hospital in South Weymouth said it lost 14 years’ worth of records on 800,000 patients, employees, volunteers, and vendors. The hospital blamed an outside data management company for losing a batch of records they had been ordered to destroy.

Other major breaches included an incident in May, when the state’s Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development found a virus in its computer system that transmitted data to unidentified hackers. The agency said that files on 210,000 state residents were compromised. A similar virus attack in June affected the records of more than 2,000 patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Among major data breaches this year was a case in April, when the e-mail marketing firm Epsilon Data Management LLC reported that data thieves had stolen the e-mail addresses of as many as 60 million people. In the same month, Japan’s Sony Corp. revealed that three of its online gaming networks had been raided by hackers, who had compromised the credit card numbers of 101 million people worldwide.

The incidents in Massachusetts have involved far fewer victims. In 82 percent of reported breaches in the state, fewer than 100 people were affected; in 30 percent of the cases, just one person’s information was at risk.

Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego, said that consumers would be even better served by being able to sue companies that lose their data. “Unfortunately, there have been very few successful lawsuits,’’ said Givens, because it’s hard to prove that someone whose information was lost or stolen has actually been harmed by the loss.

Givens said that laws like the one in Massachusetts are the next best thing. They force companies to publicly acknowledge the problem and take action to upgrade their security policies.

Coakley said companies must do more to protect the personal data in their files. “They need to be able to have up-to-date systems that both prevent a breach and identify breaches when they occur,’’ she said.","healthcare","5",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

	Betfair did not disclose in last year’s flotation prospectus full details of a big cyberattack on customers’ credit card details, but it insisted that all of its advisers for the initial public offering knew about the extent of the incident.

The betting exchange operator issued its prospectus in September last year, six months after the cyberattack that resulted in the theft of more than 3m Betfair account names, 2.9m user names and addresses and nearly 90,000 bank account details.

Betfair, which processes 5m transactions a day on average, did not tell customers about the theft, which it said was of no fraudulent use to the cybercriminals because of encryption and which was recovered intact. It informed the Serious Organised Crime Agency of the attack.

In its prospectus, Betfair referred in its “risk factors” section to the potential for disruption to its technology, saying its controls “may not be effective in detecting any intrusion or other security breaches, or safeguarding against sabotage, hackers, viruses and cybercrime”.

The Betfair prospectus added: “Betfair has experienced a limited number of security breaches in the past (which have not had a significant effect on Betfair’s reputation, operations, financial performance and prospects and in respect of which remedial action has been taken).

“Any failure in these protections could harm the company’s business reputation and have a material adverse effect on the operations, financial performance and prospects of Betfair.”

People with knowledge of the situation at Betfair, which spent about £5m ($8m) on information security last year, said the company took advice from third parties on what disclosure was required in the prospectus, and that there was full disclosure of the cyberattack with these parties.

The Daily Telegraph revealed that a report commissioned by Betfair into the attack had criticised the company’s information security and its governance, and that the business had been “exposed to significant risks”.

Betfair said that at the time of the theft, it had contacted all relevant authorities. “It was established that there was no risk to customers,” it said.

“We have subsequently implemented all of the recommendations from the independent reports we commissioned and have done everything we can to minimise the risk of this happening again.”

After falling at the start of the day, Betfair shares closed 2.5p higher at 741.5p.

The breach occurred in September 2010, when Google's modified its search engine to make it capable of finding and indexing file transfer protocol (FTP) servers, the Yale Daily News reported. As a result, the data on the 43,000 people — all of whom were affiliated with the school in 1999 — became, essentially, public property for the next 10 months.

The exposed FTP server did not contain addresses, birth dates or any financial information, Yale's information technology services director Len Peters told the Yale Daily News. Peters added that there is no indication anyone has been exploited because of the breach.
Yale discovered its misstep on June 30 and promptly blocked the FTP server from the Internet and deleted all the server's data, Computerworld reported. The university is offering all of the potentially compromised victims identity theft insurance and free credit report monitoring services for two years.

Yale's incident occurred the same week hackers accessed a Purdue University server containing the Social Security numbers of more than 7,000 former students. Just days before that, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee discovered malware on a server holding the records of 75,000 past and present students.

"67","Morgan Stanley Smith Barney","34,000","2011","Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Breach: Losing Client Data the Old Fashioned Way

A few days ago, a friend of mine received several letters dated June 24, 2011 from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where he has kept brokerage accounts for himself and his children for many years. It began with the now familiar, ""we care about you"" phrase:

""At Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, client satisfaction and information security are critical priorities.""

Then it segues into the sickeningly familiar, ""but perhaps not enough"" phrase:

""We are writing to inform you of a recent security incident involving the sensitive information of certain Morgan Stanley Smith Barney account holders. Morgan Stanley was recently notified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance that two password-protected CD ROMs included in the package received from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney were missing from the package when it was delivered to the intended recipient within the Department. The CD ROMs included sensitive information about your account that was sent as a requirement to New York State after filing annual 1099 tax forms. The sensitive information on the password-protected CD-ROMs included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney account numbers and income earned on tax exempt bonds or funds you hold or held in 2010.""

Melding into the ""we are praying daily that this never amounts to anything, because we don't want to be sued into the Stone Age"" phrase:

""While we have no evidence that your sensitive account information has been misused as a result of this incident…""

The omitted, yet operative word here is—yet.

As I said in last week's column, in 2011 breach sightings have rapidly evolved from the Flavor of the Month, to news reel of the week, to ""News at Eleven."" And letters like this have become so common it's easy not to take them seriously. Their seemingly white noise status has begun to afford them the same recognition as the magazine marketing material and pre-approved credit card mailers we find almost every day in our snail mail box. However, this is far from junk mail. And this letter, in particular, deserves some careful parsing and thought.

Like all these ""dear Vic(tim)"" letters, it begins with a statement that belies the message that follows. How critical of a priority is information security if those CD-ROMs were merely password protected, not encrypted? Is it standard operating procedure at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney not to encrypt, or is the NY State Tax Department lacking the technology to decrypt? Further, note the careful phraseology which subtly implies those CD-ROMs might have been taken by anyone involved in the transportation chain, including a NYS employee, before the package was actually delivered ""to the intended recipient within the Department."" Heck, maybe the dog ate 'em.

Of course the best question is why CD-ROMs were used to transmit the data in the first place. Since reporting of this kind is done routinely every year, why shouldn't there be a secure communications link between the sender and the recipient? And it would be cheaper, too—something state government really does care about at this particular moment.

What this letter really says is that after all the coverage of all of the breaches, all the horror stories, all the misery, all the litigation, all the heroic pronouncements by all the regulators, legislators, corporate leaders and consumer advocates, the memo still didn't get to Wall Street where they obviously care more about intellectual property, trade secrets, inside trading, outsized profits and complaining about over-regulation than their most precious asset: their customers.

Oh, and btw, MSSB customers, just in case you thought that your Social Security number was still secure (however unlikely that is) some bad guy is very likely to get it real soon.

Why am I so certain that foul play was involved here? Because this isn't the personal identifying information of an un-homogenized list of individuals—this is a list of folks who have accounts at a first-tier investment bank, and who hold tax-exempt securities in those accounts. We're not simply talking about a feast for the financially-famished, this is a top-hat dinner and a show!

There is a sophisticated and efficient market out there for personal identifying information (PII), and the prices go up when the data comes from a target-rich environment like Morgan Stanley. Now think about it: whether you're an account executive, a messenger, or a clerk in a state bureaucracy it's easy for you to know that this market exists. You also know that the chances of getting caught are even lower than finding a front row seat to a Lady Gaga concert because the ""security"" around those CD-ROMs was virtually nonexistent. Most five-year olds can get around passwords, and there are literally scores of people who could have heisted the discs from the package. Best of all, you know that you never have to meet your ""fence""—it's not like stealing the Rolex off of the sink in the men's washroom—you can transmit the data with complete anonymity, and get paid for it with little, if any, risk of exposure. And you don't have to be a computer geek; that's the real beauty of this sort of ""old-fashioned"" brand of identity theft. Hacking or phishing may require certain technical skills, but lifting a CD-ROM can be done by my seven-year-old neice. In a nutshell, we've just identified the real cause of the pandemic-like problem we are having: if you'd like to become an identity thief, you don't need to know very much; because security measures are so lax or ineffective, it's not too difficult; and the very minimal risk is far outweighed by the very tangible and ever-growing rewards. We have managed to create the perfect environment for making crime pay.

So, perhaps you haven't received ""the letter"" proclaiming your unsolicited membership in the ""500 Million File Club"" (now that more than 500 million files have been improperly accessed since 2005). I bet you're probably thinking, ""Hey, I'm not a rich guy."" Or, ""I don't have a brokerage account."" Or, ""I don't live in the U.S. where there is an established network of data thieves and data buyers."" ""I'm OK. I am under the radar.""

Think again.

On November 20, 2007, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced:

""Two password-protected discs containing a full copy of HMRC's [the UK equivalent of the IRS] entire data in relation to the payment of child benefit was sent to the NAO [the National Accounting Office] by HMRC's internal post system operated by the courier TNT. The package was not recorded or registered. It appears the data has failed to reach the address in the NAO.""

Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

The lost data involved almost half of the UK's population—approximately 25 million people. The personal data on the missing discs was said to include names, addresses and dates of birth of children receiving Child Benefits, as well as the National Insurance account numbers and the bank account data of their parents.

The BBC detailed the magnitude of the loss as follows:

* 7.25 million adult claimants of Child Benefits for their offspring;

* 15.5 million children entitled to receive those benefits;

* 2.25 million non-parent adult claimants such as unrelated caregivers, and a few thousand others.

This was truly equal-opportunity thievery. And like every other catastrophic breach, reassurance—however meaningless—quickly followed the announcement. Mr. Darling averred that there was no indication that the details had fallen into the wrong hands, but he advised those affected to monitor their bank accounts nonetheless. He said, ""If someone is the innocent victim of fraud as a result of this incident, people can be assured they have protection under the Banking Code so they will not suffer any financial loss as a result.""

Uh-huh. What about years from now when those kids grow up?

Of course, the UK being the interesting island that it is, there were some colorful reactions to the news, particularly as to the value of the loss to identity thieves. The head of the Liberal Democratic Party estimated that the names were worth approximately one hundred dollars apiece for a total value of approximately $2.5 billion. Scotland Yard unofficially speculated that it was more like four dollars apiece, amounting to a mere $100 million. Me thinks the politician was closer to it than the policeman, but prices have gone up since then anyway. Some identities can trade for several thousands of dollars, particularly if they are usable to evade immigration laws, or if the data comes with a good pedigree—like that of a Morgan Stanley investor.

Until we have better laws, stronger security procedures, and a very different attitude toward PII and its value, we will suffer in the swarm—rich or poor. No one will die, but everyone will likely be stung at least once, and possibly many times, and very harmfully. And just like a run through a swarm of bees, some of your attackers can be seen, some cannot, and even the ones who don't know a keyboard from a keychain can deliver a nasty sting—the old-fashioned way.

 This article is more than 8 years old
Customers of Barclaycard US, Capital One and other companies warned after attack on marketing email provider Epsilon
Computer hackers have stolen the names and email addresses of millions of people in one of the largest internet security breaches in US history.

The names and email addresses of customers of Barclaycard US, Capital One and other large firms were taken in an attack on the marketing email provider Epsilon last week. British customers of Barclays Bank, which owns Barclaycard US, were not affected. A spokesman for Barclaycard US confirmed to the Guardian that it would continue to work with Epsilon despite the breach.

Other information, such as passwords or credit card details, are not thought to have been exposed. However, some banks have warned customers to expect fraudulent emails attempting to solicit further login details.

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which investigates data breaches of this kind, said it was making inquiries into whether any Britons were among those affected.

Epsilon, which provides marketing services via email to about 2,500 companies, put a warning on its website on Friday stating that its systems had been ""exposed by an unauthorised entry"" into its email system. Epsilon said it would not be comment further on the breach when contacted by the Guardian. It is not yet known who perpetrated the attack, which US law enforcement agencies have begun investigating.

""The information that was obtained was limited to email addresses and/or customer names only,"" Epsilon said in its statement. ""A rigorous assessment determined that no other personal identifiable information associated with those names was at risk. A full investigation is currently underway.""

Over the weekend, dozens of Epsilon clients began to warn customers that their email addresses may have been stolen. Some of the largest financial institutions in the US, such as JPMorgan and Citigroup, are among the companies affected. Best Buy and Walt Disney subsidiary Disney Destinations also began warning its customers about the security breach. The list of companies affected is expected to continue to grow.

TiVo, the US video-on-demand company, wrote to its customers on Sunday morning: ""Please note, it is possible you may receive spam email messages as a result. We want to urge you to be cautious when opening links or attachments from unknown third parties.""

A list of millions of email addresses with their source is likely to be incredibly lucrative for so-called ""phishing"" scams, where credible-looking emails are sent to people soliciting other sensitive information, such as bank account details.

""Losing your email address via a service to which you already belong makes it much easier for scammers to hit you with emails which match your existing interests, at least loosely,"" said Paul Ducklin of internet security firm Sophos. ""That, in turn, can make their fraudulent correspondence seem more believable.""

The attack has drawn parallels with other large-scale computer infiltrations, most notably the Heartland Payment Systems breach of 2008. More than 40m bank account details were stolen in that attack, conducted by a criminal gang led by notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez. Gonzalez was later sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Last month an Iranian hacker claimed he stole digital security certificates used for online transactions by some of the web's largest sites, including Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Skype.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Forty-one days after Sony shut down its PlayStation Network and Qriocity music service in response to a hacker attack, the company finally announced on Monday that it will fully restore all services by the end of this week.

This isn't the first time the company has set a deadline for full recovery.

On April 21, a PlayStation blog post cautioned that it might be ""a full day or two"" before PSN was restored. On May 1, Sony Executive Deputy President Kazuo Hirai told reporters that the service would be restored by the end of that week. But it wasn't until May 14 that the company announced it had started restoring some services.

“We have been conducting additional testing and further security verification of our commerce functions in order to bring the PlayStation Network completely back online,"" Hirai said in a statement.

The roughly 77 million customers who have been affected by the outage will be welcomed back with a package of free services and premium content, which depending on where they live and what device they own, may include two free games, a selection of free movie rentals and more than 100 free virtual goods.

Sony expects the attack to cost $170 million this financial year. Research data from the Ponemon Institute is less optimistic. It estimates that total cost of the breach, including an attack on Sony Online Entertainment that was discovered May 2, could reach $24 billion.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"70","US Law Enforcement","123,461","2011","AntiSec Breach Yields Huge Amount of Law Officers' Personal Data
Thousands of SSNs, dozens of bank accounts among the compromised data published by Anonymous and LulzSec hackers this week, according to security firm Identify Finder.
The publication of 10GB of information from 70 different U.S. law enforcement agencies by ""AntiSec"" hackers this week contains a staggering amount of personal data that could cause identify theft problems for years to come, according to Identity Finder CEO Todd Feinman.

Identity Finder ran its software tool for combing files for personally identifiable information (PCMag reviewed Identity Finder 5.0 here) over the 123,461 files contained in the data dump published by hackers associated with Anonymous and the disbanded hacktivist group LulzSec.

The damage: 2,719 social security numbers, 8,214 passwords, 15,798 birth dates, 48,182 street addresses, 1,531,628 email addresses, 106,691 phone numbers, 57 bank account numbers, 53 driver's license numbers, and eight credit card numbers.

""This is an example of the massive kind of identity theft we're seeing of late,"" Feinman told PCMag Monday. ""They didn't deserve this, but the fact is, law enforcement could have minimized the damage of this breach by proactive security measures.

""The only way to ensure that this sort of thing doesn't happen when hackers get hold of your data is to get rid of it. These social security numbers were sitting around in emails, and there's no reason for that.""

Feinman laid out some basic ways such data could be used to make life miserable for the individuals whose personal information has now been exposed, ranging from credit cards being sent to an identity thief's address to username-password combinations being used to access bank accounts and website memberships.

What's more, the individuals affected could face such troubles for a long time.

""These unfortunate people could be in trouble 20 years from now, because social security numbers don't expire. You're date of birth doesn't expire,"" he said.

Feinman said the organizations Identity Finder deals with have started to take such breaches much more seriously since high-profile attacks on Sony and others began to make headlines earlier this year.""

We are seeing a lot of fear out there,"" he said. ""And people are now doing a lot of cleanup. We're seeing a massive spike in business in the hospitality industry, among retailers. That's good for business but it's better to send the message out.

""And really, it's been the message since TJX lost all those credit card numbers,"" he added, referring to one of the largest thefts of credit card information on record.

The solution, according to Feinman, is that organizations have to make it policy to forbid employees from saving personal data of the sort found in the AntiSec data dump on their computers.

"" Let's stop this at the source,"" he said. ""Because look, you're going to get hacked. All these things can happen, a virus, a computer worm, a Trojan, phishing attacks, what have you. But you can stop storing social security numbers and passwords on your computer.""

Feinman did offer one good reason not to go poking through the files published by AntiSec hackers, however—Identity Finder also discovered 22 viruses contained therein.","government","3",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

The University of Wisconsin is investigating a breach which may have exposed 75,000 social security numbers of students and staff.
The University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee campus has been subject to a malware attack, which has exposed names and social security numbers of students -- past and present -- and staff alike.

Malware was discovered on a database server, which contained 75,000 social security numbers, and was shut down immediately after the malware was found.

While law enforcement and school investigators have yet to find evidence that data was stolen, the university sent out a letter to those who may have been affected by the breach.

In a statement, the vice-chancellor -- the university boss -- believes that the motive was theft of research project data; data and research programmes the university itself excels in. Staff found back-door malware, which can scan and view documents on a server, which is used by many of the university's departments to store crucial research.

One of the concerns is that the malware could have had access to other servers, indicating the likelihood of a wider hack.

The malware is thought to have been installed on May 25th, and local and federal law enforcement were called in to investigate. On June 30th, however, it was discovered that the database containing social security numbers was compromised, also.

University officials, via a notice on their website, warn students to monitor their financial information and credit card statements to be on the safe side.

This news comes only days after it was discovered that users' data, including social security numbers -- predictable in nature -- can be taken from sites like Facebook and other publicly government sites.

While data in this case may not have been downloaded -- only exposed to hackers by malware -- it once again calls questions on the data that universities have on its students.

It is, however, another reminder to users of Facebook and other social networking sites not to make birthday and date of birth data available on the web. While though it may be benign on in singular form, hacks like these, which include your full name, make you even more vulnerable to identity theft and bank account hacks more likely.","academic","2",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Malware"

While the rest of the world engaged in merriment and good cheer, hackers used the holidays to attack a United States research group that puts out a daily newsletter on security issues.

On Saturday, hackers who say they are members of the collective known as Anonymous claimed responsibility for crashing the Web site of the group, Stratfor Global Intelligence Service, and pilfering its client list, e-mails and credit card information in an operation they say is intended to steal $1 million for donations to charity. The hackers posted a list online that they say contains Stratfor’s confidential client list as well as credit card details, passwords and home addresses for some 4,000 Stratfor clients. The hackers also said they had details for more than 90,000 credit card accounts. Among the organizations listed as Stratfor clients: Bank of America, the Defense Department, Doctors Without Borders, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United Nations.

The group also posted five receipts online that it said were of donations made with pilfered credit card details. One receipt showed a $180 donation from a United States Homeland Security employee, Edmund H. Tupay, to the American Red Cross. Another showed a $200 donation to the Red Cross from Allen Barr, a recently retired employee from the Texas Department of Banking. Neither responded to requests for comment.

Mr. Barr told The Associated Press that on Friday he discovered that $700 had been transferred from his account to charities including the Red Cross, Save the Children and CARE, but that he had not been aware that the transfer was tied to a breach of Stratfor’s site.

Stratfor executives did not return calls for comment on Sunday. In an e-mail to subscribers Sunday morning, Stratfor’s chief executive, George Friedman, confirmed that the company’s site had been hacked and said his company was working with law enforcement to track down the parties responsible.

“We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other Web sites,” Mr. Friedman wrote in the e-mail. “We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained.”

Continue reading the main story
The hackers took responsibility for the Stratfor attack on Twitter and said the attack would be the beginning of a weeklong holiday hacking spree. The breach was the latest in the online group’s ongoing campaign of computer attacks which, to date, has been aimed at MasterCard, Visa and PayPal as well as groups as diverse as the Church of Scientology, the Motion Picture Association of America and the Zetas, a Mexican crime syndicate.

The breach first surfaced on Saturday when hackers defaced Stratfor’s Web site with their own message. “Merry Lulzxmas!” the group wrote in a reference to Lulz Security, a hacking group loosely affiliated with Anonymous. “Are you ready for a week of mayhem?” By Sunday afternoon, the message had been replaced with a banner message that said: “Site is currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back soon.”

According to the hackers’ online postings, the group voted on what charities to contribute to. Among their choices were cancer and AIDS research, the American Red Cross, WikiLeaks and the Tor Project, a software that enables online anonymity.

Also according to their postings, the breach appears to have been conducted in retaliation for the arrest and imprisonment of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst on trial on charges of leaking classified intelligence information and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks last year.

The attack was also likely intended to embarrass Stratfor, which specializes in intelligence and security. The hackers said they were able to obtain the credit card details because, they said, Stratfor had failed to encrypt them.

“The scary thing is that no matter what you do, every system has some level of vulnerability,” says Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force. “The more you do from an advanced technical standpoint, the more common things go unnoticed. Getting into a system is really not that difficult.”

Remember how Heartland Payment Systems took a lot of heat for announcing their breach at a time that coincided with President Obama’s inauguration? Since then, a lot of entities have been bashed a bit over the timing of their breach disclosures. As someone who tracks breaches, it became almost a given that I would find a number of disclosures on Friday afternoons, when they might be more likely to be missed by people heading out for the weekend. But a press release about breach disclosure on a Sunday? Here’s a press release I just saw:

Southern California Medical-Legal Consultants, Inc. (SCMLC) announced that electronic files containing names and social security numbers of approximately 300,000 individuals who have applied for California workers’ compensation benefits had been exposed to unauthorized access. SCMLC is a California company that represents medical providers in the recovery of billing from workers’ compensation insurance carriers.

The company was notified of the possible breach by a data security firm that discovered some of the files using a sophisticated, automated search of Google indexes. According to SCMLC, the information was stored on a computer that was intended for internal purposes only, and not linked to or accessible from any of the company’s public web pages. The data security firm has assured SCMLC that they have not and will not distribute any of the information they accessed and that their purpose in accessing the files was the prevention of identity theft.

“We take data security and privacy very seriously,” said Joel Hecht, President of SCMLC. “Unfortunately, our internal security policies and procedures were not followed. We were notified, we took immediate steps to remediate the situation and we are taking long-term measures to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. While we believe that the risk of identity theft is minimal, SCMLC is doing everything required under the law with respect to notification of anyone who could be affected by this incident.”

""Do you think every hacker announces everything they've hacked? We certainly haven't, and we're damn sure others are playing the silent game,"" LulzSec wrote. ""This is what you should be fearful of, not us releasing things publicly, but the fact that someone hasn't released something publicly.""

LulzSec, for example, is ""sitting on"" the personal data of 200,000 Brink users, a first-person shooter from Splash Damage and Bethesda Softworks, a company that has already felt the wrath of LulzSec.

""It might make you feel safe knowing we told you, so that Brink users may change their passwords,"" LulzSec said. ""What if we hadn't told you? No one would be aware of this theft, and we'd have a fresh 200,000 peons to abuse, completely unaware of a breach.""

Is all this a warning for companies to secure their data? Perhaps. But in discussing whether or not it is evil to release the average Web users' personal data for all to see, LulzSec said simply that ""this is the lulz lizard era, where we do things because we find it entertaining.""

LulzSec this week, for example, released the emails and passwords of more than 62,000 people. These were not IT execs, CIOs, or the CEOs of companies with lackluster online security measures, but average Internet users. Writing Web site Writerspace.com later confirmed that 12,000 of those emails were from its database.

On its Twitter feed and Web site, LulzSec encouraged its supporters to hack into the listed accounts and wreak havoc on their digital lives—order embarrassing products from Amazon, post vulgar status updates or photos on Facebook, for example. The group argued that people reading its Twitter feed or messages ""love the idea of wrecking someone else's online experience anonymously.""

""We release personal data so that equally evil people can entertain us with what they do with it,"" LulzSec said.

The group went on to argue that ""you'll forget about us in 3 months' time when there's a new scandal to gawk at, or a new shiny thing to click on via your 2D light-filled rectangle."" Interestingly, they did not claim to be above the law and essentially admitted to illegal activity. ""We'll continue creating things that are exciting and new until we're brought to justice, which we might well be.""

Also today, LulzSec said it was not at war with Anonymous, another clandestine Web group, something confirmed by Anonymous. ""To confirm, we aren't going after Anonymous. 4chan isn't Anonymous to begin with, and /b/ is certainly not the whole of 4chan. True story,"" LulzSec tweeted. ""Saying we're attacking Anonymous because we taunted /b/ is like saying we're going to war with America because we stomped on a cheeseburger.""

Anonymous differs slightly from LulzSec in that it usually goes after certain targets for political reasons. In recent weeks, for example, the group has targed the Web sites of governments that Anonymous believes are oppressing their people via Internet censorship. Anonymous usually also employs distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks rather than massive data dumps. Police in Spain and Turkey, however, recently arrested members of Anonymous for DDoS attacks.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Hackers have taken 1.3 million customer records from Sega's servers. In a bizarre twist, LulzSec, a group that claims responsibility for recent Sony attacks, promised revenge on Sega's behalf.
Sega is the latest game maker to have its databases hacked. The company acknowledged Sunday that information on 1.3 million customers has been stolen from an online database - though credit cards aren't part of it, Sega assured customers.
Information taken includes names, birth dates, e-mail addresses and passwords, according to e-mails sent by Sega to affected customers. The information taken was part of Sega's ""Sega Pass"" system, a registered account system Sega maintains for customers interested in newsletters and other information, and used for registering some Sega games with online components.
""To stress, none of the passwords obtained were stored in plain text,"" read the e-mail, which was sent from Sega's European offices.

Payment information associated with the Sega Pass accounts was stored by external service providers, according to Sega, so credit card information was not exposed in this infiltration.

Sega said it has reset the passwords for Sega Pass customers as a precaution. Sega Pass remained offline as this article was posted.

Both the number of accounts and severity pales in comparison to the colossal failure of Sony's PlayStation Network and Sony Online Entertainment servers in April, where hackers stole information on more than 100 million users.

The Sony network failure made the company a target in the crosshairs of hacker groups, which have tried to infiltrate other Sony online services with varying degrees of success in the weeks since.

One of those groups, which bills itself as LulzSecurity (or LulzSec), has gone above and beyond to distance itself from Sega's troubles.

""@Sega - contact us. We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked you. We love the Dreamcast, these people are going down,"" reads a tweet posted to LulzSec's Twitter account.","tech","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

Citigroup reported one percent, or an estimated 210,000, North American customers have been impacted by a security breach of the company's Citi Account Online Web portal. The Citigroup hack attack is the latest in a long string of reported security breach this year against various companies.
Stolen from Citigroup, one of the world's largest banks with 21 million U.S. customers, is bankcard holders' names, account numbers, and contact information such as e-mail addresses. The only good news is social security numbers, birth dates, and card verification codes were stored on non-compromised systems, Citi says. The hack occurred in early May and the company only came clean when the Financial Times broke the story this morning (registration required). Citi says it is in contact with law enforcement officials.
Why Citi was Quiet About Hack
Ondrej Krehel's, Chief Information Security Officer for data risk management firm Identity Theft 911, says delaying the release of details is sometimes necessary and ""depends on multiple factors, including forensic investigations discovering the scope of the hack and what data's been taken. Law enforcement can also request a delay. Each state statue has different notification requirements, however.""

Speaking to Reuters, a Citi representative said the company has ""implemented enhanced procedures"" to avoid the hack happening again.
Citi says it's contacted customers affected but despite the statement that only credit card details were stolen, the Financial Times says it's spoken to individuals who've had their debit cards cancelled too. The first customers knew was when their cards were declined at retail outlets -- embarrassing, and hardly the best way to learn of such things.

2011: The Year of the Hack?
There's been a wave of hack attacks on high-profile targets recently, such as Sony, Gmail and defense contractor Lockheed Martin, but the hacking of a bank is a rarity. Bank websites usually employ bullet-proof security, Krehel says.

""These portals are constantly monitored and scanned internally for open vulnerabilities. However, hackers who discover just one open hole get access. Corporations perform many technical assessments to measure and close their exposure, but it seems that hackers still find ways to exploit the systems.""

Hacking is Evolving into Something Different
Hackers appearing to be evolving as a species, says Krehel.

""Hacking these days is about monetization of data -- making a profit in the underground cyberworld. Perhaps that is why we no longer see site defacement being popular as the focus has shifted to consumer data, with the most favorite choice being financial data.""

In March email marketing firm Epsilon Interactive was hacked and details for Citigroup account holders were stolen, amongst others. It's not clear if that hack was a jumping-off point for May's attack.

Although names, account numbers and emails will not give cybercriminals access to account data, it does make possible effective phishing attacks. Criminals could include a customer's card number in the email, for example, which could be enough to convince them to follow a link to a bogus Website setup to capture yet more details.

With perfect bad timing just days before the hack took place, Citigroup's head of global enterprise payments (and former head of its credit card unit) -- Paul Galant -- told Reuters in April that ""security breaches happen ... the mission of the banking industry is to keep the customer base safe and customers feeling secure about their financial transactions and payments"". He added that Citigroup spends ""a tremendous amount of money on security. We take it very, very seriously -- I don't know that there's a way we could take it more seriously.""","financial","3",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Sony is not having a good year. As the company scrambles to get the PlayStation Network and Qriocity music service back online, it's suffering from yet another security breach. This time it's a hacker attack on various websites associated with Sony Pictures.

A team of individuals going by the name LulzSec, who recently managed to deface PBS.org'sepage, announced that they have broken into SonyPictures.com and compromised more than 1 million user accounts. An additional 75,000 music codes and 3.5 million coupons were also uncovered.

The attack, part of a campaign known as Sownage, was announced on Twitter and on the LulzSec website. LulzSec said that it didn't have enough resources to copy all the data that it was able to access. But the group did manage to grab a collection of databases that contain thousands of usernames.

The accounts, presumably associated with any sort of registered activity on SonyPictures.com (or its subsidiaries or partners), contain information like passwords, email addresses, dates of birth and other Sony opt-in data. This certainly isn't as dangerous as the information that was exposed during the PSN hack, but it could still be used to gather access to more important accounts elsewhere.

The scariest part of this attack isn't what was taken, but how easy it was for the LulzSec members to take it. According to the groups own press release, access to the main Sony Pictures website was gained using a very basic tactic called a SQL injection. We haven't had a chance to examine the released files to see what this injection was, but it's likely that an out-of-date software stack and relatively unprotected web server made passing the injection trivial.

LulzSec says that all of the information it took was unencrypted. ""Sony stored over 1,000,000 passwords of its customers in plaintext,"" says the hackers' press release, ""which means it's just a matter of taking it. ""

Seeing as this is the second security breach of a major Sony-branded website in just outside of a week, we have to ask: Is anyone at Sony employed to handle web security?

Sure, managing a large number of brands and properties that are often connected in name only has to be a challenge, not to mention the logistical and administrative challenges of managing websites that can store millions of user profiles. Still, that doesn't make up for what by all appearances is an abysmal security record.

LulzSec has been on a tear, infiltrating the websites and databases for the UK television program, The X Factor, parts of Fox.com, Sonymusic.co.jp and many parts of PBS.org in the past three weeks alone.

The attacks, while often juvenile in nature and execution (the Lulzsecurity.com website plays the theme from The Love Boat), underscore just how important it is for brands to keep their web servers updated, hardened and monitored. In the age of simple publishing tools like WordPress, it's easy for managers to underestimate the importance of having someone on contract or on staff to keep data encrypted and protected. We can only hope the most recent cyber attacks convince executives to think seriously about investing in online security.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

The newspaper says unknown hackers hit its job listing site on June 27 and 28, stealing user IDs and email addresses in a possible hunt for spam email targets.
Unknown hackers broke into The Washington Post's Jobs website last month, stealing about 1.27 million user IDs and email addresses, the newspaper revealed Thursday.

An ""unauthorized third party"" attacked the paper's job listings site and gained access to user information in ""two brief episodes"" on June 27 and June 28, according to the Post. Aside from the theft of user IDs and email addresses, ""no passwords or other personal information was affected,"" the newspaper stated.

The Post assured its users that ""[t]heir Jobs accounts remain secure,"" though warned that those whose email addresses were stolen may receive spam email as a result.

The newspaper did not know the precise number of individuals affected but estimated that ""roughly 1.27 million"" user accounts were accessed by the hacker or hackers. The Post did not elaborate on the methods used by the intruders or vulnerabilities in its systems that might have given outsiders access to users' private information.

""We quickly identified the attack and took action to shut it down,"" the paper's announcement stated. The Post claimed it had ""implemented additional measures to prevent against a similar act in the future,"" is auditing the Jobs site's security framework, and is cooperating with law enforcement in investigating the intrusion.

The security breach is the latest in a series of high-profile and seemingly random cyber-attacks on corporate and government properties that have made headlines in recent months, including several that targeted media organizations like Fox.com and PBS.org, as well as gaming networks like Sony's PlayStation Network.

But unlike recent attacks carried out by ""hacktivists"" like Anonymous and LulzSec that seem politically motivated and even prank-like, the Post intrusion may have been the work of traditional profit-motivated cybercriminals, if the paper's contention that collecting email addresses to spam was the motive.","media","2",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Second major breach for Health Net in two years
There were stories yesterday like this one at Health Leaders Media and this one at the LA Times reporting that California-based insurer Health Net has suffered yet another massive data breach, this time involving 1.9 million current and past customers, health-care providers and employees. The information involved may include their names, addresses, health information, Social Security numbers and/or financial information, the company said.

In 2009, Health Net reported that a hard drive containing seven years worth of financial and medical information on 1.5 million customers went missing. The drive was lost in May of 2009, but this fact wasn't reported until November of that year. The company was fined by both Vermont and Connecticut for that little oversight and for not taking adequate care of its customers' sensitive information.

This time, as many as nine servers have gone missing from Health Net's data center that is operated by IBM and is located in Rancho Cordova, California. According to its statement, the company said it is conducting an investigation into the loss.
Furthermore:

""To help protect the personal information of affected individuals, Health Net is offering them two years of free credit monitoring services, including fraud resolution and, if necessary, restoration of credit files, as well as identity theft insurance.""

This protection is being offered out of what the company calls ""an abundance of caution.""
No doubt getting hit with heavy fines by state regulators for the previous data breach also helped increase that abundance of corporate caution, which would have been very useful before the servers went missing.

Earlier this month, there was another health-related data breach reported involving some 300,000 people. This incident involved three unencrypted storage tapes, a laptop, a zip drive and a hard drive all being stolen from the car of an employee of the Cord Blood Registry, which its website says, is a ""cord blood bank [that] has helped many families use their stem cells for lifesaving transplants and other therapies.""
The theft took place in mid-December of last year, but was only disclosed in early March of this year.

According to this blog post at NetWorkWorld, the company says that:

""The tapes may have contained personal client data of adults (credit card numbers, driver's license numbers or social security numbers); nothing on children and no health information at all.""

A laptop computer stolen from a Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System employee’s car in late March compromised the personal and medical billing information of an unknown number of patients.
The information on the computer was in a password-protected file and included Social Security numbers as well as names, addresses, dates of birth and medical billing codes, according to the system.
System spokesman Chad Lawson said Friday that there is no evidence any patients have been harmed.
Lawson said medical-billing codes are simply combinations of numbers that describe what a patient is being billed for, such as an office visit, and not descriptions of patient care.
He said the system has determined which patients have been affected by the breach, but refused to comment on how many patients had information on the computer.
“That’s one of the pieces of this that we’re just not going to disclose right now,” Lawson said.
He said an information breach affecting just one patient would have initiated the same procedure used Friday, when the system sent an email to employees informing them of the breach.
The employee who reported the stolen computer told the hospital on March 29 that the computer was stolen the night before.
Lawson said the employee was authorized to have the computer, but said because the issue is a personnel matter, the system would not comment on whether the employee was disciplined in the wake of the theft.
The system on Friday mailed letters to patients who had information in the file.
In the letters the system explains that it will offer credit protection and identity theft consultation and restoration service to affected patients at no cost for one year.
The letters provide contact information for the service.
“We encourage anybody who gets that letter to call that number,” Lawson said.
He said the system is in the process of revising its security procedures and already made some changes in the wake of the theft.
An investigation into the theft is ongoing, Lawson said.
A different desktop computer was stolen from the system in early March, though the system said the computer did not contain patient information.

Missing laptop one of 20 stolen from North London storeroom
The NHS has admitted losing a laptop packed with up to 8.6 million medical records in a large-scale data breach that went unreported for three weeks.

The breach stems from the loss of “a number of laptops” from a North London storeroom and is being investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office.

“NHS North Central London is investigating the loss of a number of laptops,” the health authority said. “One of the machines was used for analysing health needs, requiring access to elements of unnamed patient data.”
One of the machines was used for analysing health needs, requiring access to elements of unnamed patient data

The authority has given few details of the case, but a report in The Sun claims 20 laptops went missing and only eight have since been retrieved. Police were “dismayed"" that the health authority had taken so long to report the issue.

A spokesperson for the NHS told PC Pro that it couldn't comment on what was on the remaining missing laptops because the investigation was ongoing.

The NHS stressed that patients were unnamed in the records, but with details including postcodes and gender, and information relating to cases including HIV, cancer and abortion, there are fears that individuals could be identified if security measures on the laptops were bypassed.

“All the laptops were password protected and our policy is to manually delete the data from laptops after the records have been processed,” the NHS statement said.
The ICO confirmed it was investigating the issue. “Any allegation that sensitive personal information has been compromised is concerning and we will now make enquiries to establish the full facts of this alleged data breach,” the watchdog said.

The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission says customer data was on a server that had malware on it.
The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is warning its customers that their personal data may have been exposed in a recent breach, an SFPUC spokesman told CNET today.

SFPUC noticed a few weeks ago that an unsecured server that was storing customer data also had some viruses on it, according to spokesman Tyrone Jue. It's unclear how the server got infected with the viruses, he said, adding that ""it looked like someone had found an open port on the server and dumped a bunch of viruses on it.""

A file on the server contained customer names, account numbers, addresses, phone numbers and some e-mail addresses for SFPUC's 180,000 customers, but did not contain any financial information, he said.

""The server was open (to the Internet) and had an encoded file on there with all of our customer data,"" Jue said. The file was in plain text but the data was somewhat jumbled, making it difficult to correctly match data to specific customers, he added.

""There was no indication that any information was taken, but in the interest of caution we are notifying customers of the fact,"" Jue said.

The agency has been sending notices out in customer bills and sending e-mails to anyone who had an e-mail address that was in the file on the server, he said.

""The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) recently discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to a SFPUC computer system.

The widely publicized hack of Sony's computer networks is worse than previously thought, also affecting 24.6 million Sony Online Entertainment network accounts.

Sony -- which has kept its Sony PlayStation Network offline for nearly two weeks as it investigates a computer intrusion -- took a second gaming network offline on Monday, saying it too appears to have been hacked. It said banking and credit card information belonging to more than 23,000 customers outside the U.S. may have been compromised.

The Sony Online Entertainment network, used for massively multiplayer online games like EverQuest, Star Wars Galaxies and Matrix Online, has been suspended temporarily, Sony said Monday. Add this to the 77 million accounts that may have been compromised last week, and Sony is responsible for one of the largest recorded data breaches.

The entertainment network is separate from the PlayStation Network but both hacks have similar traits, said Mai Hora, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment in Tokyo.

In both cases, the stolen data includes customer names, e-mail addresses and hashed versions of their account passwords. That data could be used to spam customers or trick them with phishing e-mails.

Last week Sony said PlayStation Network and Qriocity users may have had their credit card numbers accessed, but that those numbers were encrypted. Sony now says some credit card numbers may have been taken from a different database. It did not say if that data was encrypted.

The hackers gained access to an ""outdated database from 2007,"" Sony said in its press release. That database included card numbers and expiration dates for 12,700 customers based outside of the U.S., and direct withdrawal data belonging to some customers in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.

Sony has been dealing for weeks with the public relations crisis spawned by the hacks. On Sunday, as the head of Sony's gaming division was apologizing for the hack in a news conference, investigators were learning about the Sony Online Entertainment and credit card database hacks.

Last week, rumors surfaced on underground hacking forums that the thieves had obtained millions of credit card numbers, but Sony maintains that this is untrue.

While Tokyo-based Sony Corp. battles massive data security breaches, Japanese carmaker Honda is confronting its own online challenge — the theft of personal information from 283,000 Honda and Acura customers in Canada.

Jerry Chenkin, executive vice-president and chief compliance officer at Honda Canada Inc., confirmed Thursday that names, addresses and vehicle identification numbers were taken from the company’s eCommerce websites myHonda and myAcura, with suspicious activity on the site first detected in late February.

In a letter to affected vehicle owners dated May 13 and obtained by the Toronto Star, Honda Canada said it was alerted by unusual volume on the sites, including “some unauthorized attempts to access account information.” The letter said financial information was not compromised.

Honda, which does not sell customer data to third parties, is investigating the incident, which has been reported to police. Perpetrators have not been identified and no group has claimed responsibility.

The letter warns of “possible improper access of information,” but said customers are not at risk for fraud and identity theft. Chenkin said federal and provincial privacy commissions were notified and customers were warned of the breach “as soon as possible.”

A spokesperson for the federal privacy commissioner said the office has received inquiries from Honda customers about the breach “and over concern about the timing” (of the notification), adding that the office is looking at the issue and is in discussions with Honda Canada.

The letter said customers should be on the alert for marketing overtures that reference ownership of a Honda or Acura vehicles.

Chenkin said data was breached in personal addresses or URLs assigned to customers using the sites, adding that the addresses were shut down immediately after the breach was detected.

He said Honda believed the records contained in a 2009 database were destroyed by a vendor that handled the project. “Apparently, they were not.”

Birth dates, telephone numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers, bank accounts and information on Honda financial services transactions were not taken, he added.

Honda late last year warned more than two million of its customers in the U.S. that an email database containing some of their personal information had been stolen.

The list contained names, login identities, email addresses and vehicle identification numbers of the Honda owners, while another list containing only the email addresses of nearly three million Acura owners was also taken.

Chenkin said Honda responded to the U.S. breaches with an audit of it online security practices and its web vendors.

The concern is that affected customers, especially those on the list with the VINs, may be targeted for some kind of “phishing” attack from someone pretending to be a local Honda dealer who correctly identifies the recently purchased vehicle and requests more personal information to trigger “special offers.”

Online security experts said the information can ultimately be used to steal identities.

The Honda incidents highlight the growing threat to online data bases.

Sony, which Thursday forecast a return to profit for this fiscal year after sinking into its third straight year of red ink, has been hammered by the costs of massive online security breaches that have affected millions of PlayStation users.

Breaches have also been reported in Germany and at a Sony Ericsson joint venture eCommerce site in Canada. Online “hacktivists” upset with Sony’s hardline on copyright issues have claimed responsibility for the attack in Canada.

Sony also faces a new kind of challenge to its reputation after acknowledging a massive security breach affecting more than 100 million online accounts, and was forced to close down its online gaming services last month.

Sony is expecting costs related to its online security woes of 14 billion yen ($173 million), covering customer support, freebie packages, legal costs, lower sales and measures to beef up security.

Sheriff’s detectives arrested Tim Nuss on April 28 in east Multnomah County. They say he had access to an old Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles database.

Spokesman David House says the DMV database was once sold to marketing companies, but the department stopped selling the information in the late 1990s.

House says the sold data include the names, addresses, birth dates, gender and ages of people who registered with the DMV, but no financial information.

[…]
Prosecutors have charged Nuss with 26 counts of aggravated identity theft — one count for each letter of the alphabet representing his potential victims.

So how much did the state make by selling the lists and how much has that sale cost in terms of ID theft or state personnel time investigating crimes that used these lists? And no, I won’t even ask what recourse victims have, because we all know that individuals generally have no real recourse or private cause of action.

The Steam video game service, used by 35 million people, has been compromised by hackers.

Its owner and operator, Valve, uncovered an intrusion into a user database while investigating a security breach of its discussion forums.

The attackers used login details from the forum hack to access a database that held ID and credit card data.

Valve said that, so far, it had no evidence that credit cards were being misused or Steam accounts abused.

Losing trust
The defacement took place on 6 November and the Steam forums were taken offline when Valve learned of the attack.

At first the firm said the discussion groups were offline for maintenance.

However, a message posted to the front page of the forums by Valve boss Gabe Newell on 10 November has revealed that the sites were shut down because of the defacement.

Valve's investigation of that incident revealed that the ""the intrusion goes beyond the Steam forums"".

The initial investigation showed that the attackers gained access to a Steam database that held ""user names, hashed and salted passwords, game purchases, email addresses, billing addresses and encrypted credit card information"".

Valve has not said whether this was the full database of Steam's 35 million active accounts or a subset of that total.

Mr Newell said Valve had no evidence that the encrypted credit card information or personal information on gamers had been taken. However, he added, ""we are still investigating"".

He said it had only discovered that a few forum accounts had been compromised and used to carry out the defacement.

But Mr Newell added that all forum users will be required to change their passwords when the discussion site re-opens, which the firm is trying to achieve as quickly as possible.

He advised users to change passwords on other accounts if they are the same as the one used for the Steam forums.

""I am truly sorry this happened, and I apologize for the inconvenience,"" concluded Mr Newell.

Code changes
Steam is a gaming service that lets people buy, download, play and chat about a huge variety of games, only some of which are made by Valve itself.

About 1,500 titles are currently available on Steam including Skyrim, LA Noire and Modern Warfare 3 as well as many independent and free games.

Security expert Paul Ducklin, writing on the blog of security firm Sophos, handed down advice about what to do following the breach.

He said users should change passwords, monitor credit card statements, consider removing card numbers from Valve's servers and sign up for the Steam Guard security service.

He also urged users to insist businesses take steps to make it much harder for hackers to penetrate their systems and use stolen data.

""Community pressure has persuaded many businesses to improve their password-handling code,"" he said.","tech","3",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Cybercrooks presumed to be operating from Russia hacked into the Restaurant Depot database last month and accessed the credit and debit card details of more than 100,000 customers.

In a Nov. 25 notice, Stanley Fleishman, the chief executive officer of Restaurant Depot and supermarket wholesaler Jetro Cash & Carry, informed affected customers that ""unauthorized persons obtained the names of cardholders, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates, and verification codes that were on the magnetic stripes of credit and debit cards used at our stores from September 21 through November 18, 2011.""

Online thieves employed identical tactics late last month to steal shoppers' credit card data from 20 branches of the Silicon Valley grocery store chain Lucky Supermarkets.

The Restaurant Depot incident came to light on Nov. 9, when customers reported that they'd become victims of credit card fraud. The following day, Restaurant Depot hired Trustwave, a computer forensics firm, to investigate.

Restaurant Depot's memo did not provide details about the nature of the data breach or who was behind it, but according to the technology news website Finextra, cybercriminals placed malware onto the credit and debit card processing systems used in Restaurant Depot's stores, and then harvested the stolen data and sent it to a server in Russia.

In the wake of the massive data breach, Restaurant Depot is urging affected customers to notify their credit card providers and monitor their bank statements for any evidence of fraud. The company is also warning customers who shopped at the restaurant wholesaler to be aware of phishing emails or phone calls from people asking for confidential information.","retail","3",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s communications regulator said on Saturday that personal information of more than 13 million subscribers of a popular online game of Nexon Korea Corp, a leading game developer in the country, had been leaked in a hacking attack.

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said in a statement Nexon reported to the commission late Friday afternoon that the company on Thursday discovered the leakage of personal data of its online game Maple Story’s 13.2 million subscribers.

The information was leaked weeks before the unlisted company’s planned initial public offering of its Japanese affiliate on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on December 14. Nexon aims to raise more than 95 billion yen ($1.2 billion) through the IPO, which would be the largest on the Tokyo bourse this year.

KCC said it, jointly with police and computer security experts, is investigating the hacking case. The leaked data included user IDs, names, resident registration numbers and passwords, it added.

A Nexon official said the leaked data neither covered no information on financial transactions and bank account numbers. And it did not affect overseas subscribers of the online game.

The company has asked game subscribers to change passwords to prevent additional damage, although the leaked resident registration numbers and passwords were encrypted. The entire subscription membership of Maple Story is about 18 million, the company official said.

Nexon, which has gained a global reputation through Maple Story and online game Kart Rider, is one of the two leading online game developers in South Korea, along with NCsoft Corp.

The incident is the largest such security breach case since late July when information of up to 35 million users of an Internet portal and blogging site operated by SK Comms was attacked by hackers from China, exposing the vulnerabilities of networks in the world’s most wired country.

Accusations against China over hacking incidents have mounted this year, with allegations it intruded into the networks of Lockheed Martin and other U.S. military contractors and tried to gain access to the Google email accounts of U.S. officials and Chinese human rights advocates.

South Korea has drawn up a cyber security master plan after a wave of hacking attacks against global agencies, companies and its own financial firms.

In April, government-funded Nonghyup, a large commercial bank, suffered a massive network failure that affected millions of users. Seoul prosecutors at the time said North Korean hackers were responsible for the attack.

In May, hackers breached the personal information of 1.8 million customers of Hyundai Capital, which is owned by Hyundai Motor and GE Capital International.","tech","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"
"93","Sutter Medical Foundation","4,243,434","2011","Sutter Health sued for $1 billion following data breach

A group of patients filed a class-action lawsuit against Sutter Health this week, after it was revealed a laptop containing information on more than 4 million patients was stolen from the headquarters of the Sutter Medical Foundation (SMF) in Natomas, California.

The lawsuit, filed in the Sacramento Superior Court on behalf of plaintiff Karen Pardieck, is seeking $1,000 for each of the 944,000 patients involved in the class, plus attorneys' fees. In total, the lawsuit amounts to more than $1 billion.

Earlier this month, Sutter Health revealed that a company-issued laptop had been stolen from the administrative offices of the SMF on October 15. The computer, according to a press release from Sutter Health, was password-protected, but much of the data contained on it was unencrypted. No medical records were stored on the computer, but the machine did hold a database that contained information on 3.3 million Sutter Physicians Services (SPS) patients and 943,000 SMF patients.

According to the healthcare provider, the database contained names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, medical record numbers and the name of each patient's health insurance plan. The healthcare provider explained that the data regarding the SMF patients was even more extensive, as it included dates of services and descriptions of medical diagnoses and procedures.

According to the Sacremento Bee and other news providers, the lawsuit alleges that Sutter Health was negligent in protecting its patients' sensitive information and then was slow to notify those affected by the breach.

""Sutter should've had that under lock and key,"" attorney Robert Buccola of law firm Dreyer Babich Buccola Wood, which filed the suit, said, according to the Sacramento Bee. ""If there's proprietary information in their files, they have a financial interest to make sure security is of the utmost importance.""

Sutter Health claimed that it had encrypted some of the information on other systems, according to the Sacramento Bee, but it hadn't gotten to the laptop in question.

At this point, it is unclear whether the stolen information has been misused.

Data breach notification has been a point of contention for some time, and it is playing a role in the Sutter Health case as well. According to the Sacramento Bee, Sutter spokesman Bill Gleeson contends that the healthcare provider responded appropriately to the situation after it took time to determine what was on the stolen laptop. However, those involved in the suit argue that a month is too long to wait to notify those affected by a breach.

This situation is being addressed by several bills currently making their way through the U.S. Congress. Senators Patrick Leahy and Richard Blumenthal, as well as Representative Mary Bono Mack and others, have introduced bills that would consolidate the 47 data breach notification standards currently used by the states and Washington, D.C.

In September, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Leahy's Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2011, which would create a national standard for data breach notifications. However, the proposal has not yet been made into law.

Should Congress pass Leahy's or others' bills, it could have a significant impact on cases like that of Sutter Health, as it would establish how long an organization can wait before notifying those affected by data breaches. At the moment, Sutter Health expects all patients affected by this latest incident to receive notices by December 5.","healthcare","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - A massive data breach, in which the personal and medical records of millions of military patients and their families were compromised, happened when the records were stolen out of a data contractor’s car in San Antonio, officials told Reuters on Thursday.

The information for some 4.6 million active and retired military personnel, as well as their families, was on back up-tapes from an electronic health care record used to capture and preserve patient data from 1992 through September 7 of this year, according to Science Applications International Corp (SAIC).

The families used the federal government’s TRICARE health provider. SAIC is the suburban Washington firm that handles military health provider TRICARE’s data.

The tapes went missing on September 14 when they were “among items stolen from an employee’s car in San Antonio,” SAIC spokesman Vernon Guidry told Reuters.

They were in the car, he said, because they were “being transferred from one federal facility to another in compliance with the terms of their contract.”

He said there’s no indication the car thief was after the tapes or even knew what they were.

SAIC is working with San Antonio police and a private investigator to recover the tapes, Guidry said.

After announcing the breach on Thursday, SAIC officials scrambled to reassure patients the “risk of harm to patients is judged to be low, despite the data elements involved.”

“Retrieving the data on the tapes would require knowledge of and access to specific hardware and software and knowledge of the system and data structure,” SAIC said in a statement released Thursday.

NO FINANCIAL DATA
TRICARE officials say the data on the tapes include Social Security numbers, addresses and phone numbers, and some personal data such as clinical notes, laboratory tests, and prescriptions. No financial data, such as credit card or bank account information, are on the tapes, officials said.

The SAIC statement said the company withheld information about the breach until Thursday so it could “determine the degree of risk this data loss represented before making notifications” so as “to not raise undue alarm in our beneficiaries.”

Guidry said the data cover 4.9 million patients who received treatment at military hospitals and military treatment facilities in San Antonio. The breach also includes information for patients who may have been receiving treatment at other military medical facilities, but whose laboratory work or other diagnostic work was done at San Antonio hospitals.

Despite the assurance that the risk is low, computer security expert Dwayne Williams, associate director of the Technology Research Group at the University of Texas San Antonio, said patients should take preemptive steps.

“If somebody intentionally went after this data, they are going to have the right hardware and software to read these files,” he said. “This equipment is available and can be purchased on the Internet.

SAIC and TRICARE have set up emergency response centers for patients to call to get help in dealing with the security breach, and help them to place a fraud alert on their credit reports.

TRICARE has a total of 9.6 million enrollees worldwide. It is the HMO and medical service provider for America’s active duty and retired military personnel, their families, military reservists, and some civilian Department of Defense workers.

TRICARE said in the statement that it is working with SAIC to “review current data protection security policies and procedures to prevent similar breaches in the future.”

Williams said situations like this are “scary,” but they’re part of modern life.

“If you are a citizen in the modern society, if you have a credit card, if you shop online, if you have information stored, you should anticipate that some day your information will get stolen,” he said.

“Data breaches are getting bigger and more common. You should take steps to protect your identity.”","government","4",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

Forget the attacks that have compromised thousands of accounts. This Chinese hacker managed to steal and leak the data belonging to 6 million users, before he was arrested of course.
In what is being called the biggest hacking case in China's Internet history, police have arrested a man, surnamed Zeng, suspected of leaking personal information belonging to more than 6 million users of the China Software Developer Network (CSDN). Zeng has been detained on charges of illegal acquisition of computer data.
The leak occurred on December 21, 2011, exposing user names, passwords, and e-mail addresses belonging to online shopping, gaming, social networking, and even financial service websites. Police noticed that most of the leaked data dated from July 2009 to July 2010, indicating the CSDN server was hacked before July 2010, according to Shanghai Daily.

Zeng was caught in Wenzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, on February 4, 2012 after an investigation into the case. During the inquiry, police also uncovered four other hackers doing similar deeds, and are still looking into their illegal activities. Zeng caught the police's attention because of what he posted in September 2010. He said he had gained control of the CSDN database after hacking into the CSDN server in April 2010.

After the incident, Beijing police punished CSDN for poorly securing its database. CSDN apologized to its subscribers and claimed that its server has been properly protected since September 2010. Hopefully this means it now encrypts the account details it stores, because chances are the organization will be hacked again at some point.

There are services such as PwnedList that keep track of online accounts that have been compromised, but I doubt this particular hack was recorded by this site.

Global Payments announced Friday that 1.5 million credit card numbers from its systems may have been exposed after detecting “unauthorized access” into its processing system. Here’s a quick primer on the attack, what the reaction has been and what you can do to protect yourself.

What is Global Payments? Global Payments is a third-party processing company that has clients including financial institutions, government agencies and large corporations. Clients at the time of the breach included Visa and MasterCard.

Who was affected? The company said that 1.5 million records may have been exposed, from Visa and MasterCard.

What was taken? According to the company, while credit card numbers may have been exposed, personal information such as names, addresses and Social Security numbers were “not obtained by the criminals.”

When did it happen? Global Payments detected the breach in “early March,” but has not specified when exactly the attack took place or how it happened.

What’s been done in response? According to the latest statement from Global Payments, the breach has been “contained.” The company said it is working with “industry third parties, regulators and law enforcement to assist in the efforts to minimize potential cardholder impact.” It is also working with security and forensics firms to get to the bottom of the access.

What should I be looking out for? As a cardholder, you should keep an even closer eye on your bank statements to look for unauthorized charges. Investigate and report any anomalies as quickly as possible.

Also, be aware of phishing scams. Keep in mind that no reputable firm will ever ask you to enter your username and password into an e-mail, and any e-mails asking for that information should be deleted immediately.

I think my account’s been compromised. What can I do? If you’re worried about charges you’ve found on your cards, contact your card company immediately. Cards often have a toll-free number printed on them in case of emergency.

You can also put a fraud alert on your credit report to contain the damage from bad charges. Contact the three major credit report companies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — to do so.

Update - Google kills Iranian blog with 3 million hacked bank accounts


After finding a security vulnerability in Iran's banking system, Khosrow Zarefarid wrote a formal report and sent it to the CEOs of all the affected banks across the country. When the banks ignored his findings, he hacked 3 million bank accounts, belonging to at least 22 different banks, to prove his point.
It does not appear as if Zarefarid stole money from the accounts; he merely dumped the account details of around 3 million individuals, including card numbers and PINs, on his blog: ircard.blogspot.ca. I found the link via his Facebook account, along with the question ""Is your bank card between thease 3000000 cards?""

At least three Iranian banks (Saderat, Eghtesad Novin, and Saman) have already sent text messages to their clients, warning them to change their debit card PINs, according to Kabir News. Furthermore, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) issued a statement announcing that millions of ATM cards have been hacked and urged all card holders to change their PINs, especially if they haven't done so in the last few months. The warning was repeated on state TV channels.

Some banks are currently blocking their clients' accounts to be on the safe side, and the CBI has also apologized for the inconvenience this is causing. Furthermore, many ATMs in Iran have stopped dispensing cash and only let customers change their PINs when they put in their debit card.

It's worrying that the CBI statement did not mention anything about improving security. Changing passwords isn't going to solve the root of the problem if the security flaw isn't addressed. Of course, it may even already have been fixed, but it's important to let the public know of your plans and/or progress.

Zarefarid previously worked as a manager at a company called Eniak, which operates the Shetab (Interbank Information Transfer Network) system, an electronic banking clearance and automated payments system used in Iran. The company also manufactures and installs point of sale (POS) devices. In other words, Zarefarid worked for a firm that offered services to Iranian banks for accepting electronic payments.

A year ago (Iran's last calendar year ended on March 19), Zarefarid discovered the security hole and notified all affected banks of its presence. He even provided them with information about the bank accounts of 1,000 customers. When none of them responded, Zarefarid decided to make his findings public.

Zarefarid is reportedly no longer in Iran, though it is unclear when he left. He insists he hacked the accounts to highlight the vulnerability in Iran's banking system.

Approximately 800,000 people in California’s child support system may be at risk of identity theft or other privacy issues after their private records were lost in transit earlier this month. 
Since no one is certain where the records may be located, officials are alerting individuals that they could be impacted by the major error.

Child Support Data Goes Missing in Transit
The California Department of Child Support Services is scrambling to recover data after losing it in transit on March 12.

The agency had transferred the information to IBM in Boulder, CO as part of a disaster preparedness exercise that would ensure California’s child support system could be operated remotely. After the exercise was deemed successful, the files were to be transported back to the child support department via Iron Mountain, Inc. road transportation.

Before they reached their destination, however, four computer storage devices went missing which contained the following information:

Social Security numbers
Names
Addresses
Driver’s license numbers
Names of health insurance providers
As announced by the department, the improperly-secured container also held information about employers for custodial and non-custodial parents, as well as details on children in the system.

Identity Theft a Major Risk for Those Affected
The department said in its announcement made on Thursday that it has already notified all those possibly affected by the data loss. To head off issues with identity theft,the department notified the three major credit bureaus, as well as the state attorney general’s office and the state Office of Privacy Protection.

In addition to taking these steps, the child support department is recommending that individuals affected by the breach place a fraud alert on their credit cards and take steps to obtain copies of credit reports to protect their identities.

The agency did explain there’s a chance that the lost information won’t be accessible because a specialized machine is needed to run the cartridges the data is store on. Also, special hardware and software is needed to read it.

But because hackers often have highly-sophisticated technology that enables them to access secure files, it’s best that individuals affected take additional steps to ensure their privacy remains intact.

Emory Healthcare has determined that 10 backup discs containing information on surgical patients treated between September 1990 and April 2007 are missing from a storage location at Emory University Hospital. As soon as it was discovered that the discs were missing, an extensive search and investigation was initiated and is continuing. It is important to note that there was no actual or attempted breach or ""hacking in"" of Emory's electronic medical records or other systems.  

The information contained on the discs is related to approximately 315,000 surgical patients treated at Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown (formerly known as Emory Crawford Long Hospital) and The Emory Clinic Ambulatory Surgery Center. The information did not relate to patients at other Emory Healthcare facilities or to patients treated after April 2007.  

All affected patients, at Emory Healthcare's cost, will be provided access to identity protection services, including credit monitoring, through Kroll, Inc., a company specializing in such services.  

Approximately 228,000 of the patient records included Social Security numbers; another approximately 87,000 records did not include Social Security numbers. The discs contained certain protected health information, including the patient names, dates of surgery, diagnoses, procedure codes or the name of the surgical procedures, device implant information, surgeon names and anesthesiologist names.  

""We sincerely regret this incident and want to assure our patients that we are committed to safeguarding their personal information,"" said John T. Fox, president and CEO of Emory Healthcare. ""While we have no evidence at this time that any personal information has been misused as a result of this incident, we want to take all precautions to ensure our patients' information is safe. We are moving forward expeditiously with providing all affected patients, at our cost, access to identity protection services, including credit monitoring.""  

The investigation has determined that the discs were removed sometime between February 7, 2012, and February 20, 2012. They contained data files from an obsolete software system that was deactivated in 2007. This deactivated system was accessed very infrequently and only as requested by either patients or their physicians. The last time data were accessed was in 2010.   

Patients are being informed through personal letters mailed to their homes beginning April 17. The letter provides details on what has occurred, actions taken to locate the discs and steps patients can take now to protect themselves against possible identity theft, as well as information on placing a fraud alert on their credit file. Emory Healthcare is recommending that individuals regularly review their credit reports for anything they do not recognize, and to consider using the other services Emory is providing, as specified in the letter. For more information on steps patients can take to avoid potential problems, view Emory Healthcare's ""Notice to Our Patients"" at www.emoryhealthcare.org/protection.

Emory Healthcare has launched an institution-wide initiative to reinforce and clarify existing policies and procedures for safeguarding the security and privacy of sensitive information.

The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott mistakenly gave attorneys access to millions of Social Security numbers in a case against the state’s voter ID law, officials admitted Wednesday.

The numbers were included with a voter database the state was ordered to turn over to plaintiff attorneys. Abbott’s office reportedly said that only the last four digits were supposed to be visible, but they were later informed that was not the case, and that up to 6.5 million Social Security numbers were compromised.

Abbott’s office insists the data was not exposed to the public. He reportedly dispatched police officers to collect copies of the voter database, which was contained on encrypted hard drives sent to lawyers in Boston, Washington and New York.

Texas Democratic Party spokeswoman Rebecca Acuna told The San Antonio Express News that Abbott’s mistake would not have happened if he’d “spent as much time protecting Texans as he does trying to disenfranchise them.”

Her message is approximately the same as the Obama administration’s. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced last month that it would block the Texas voter ID law, which requires voters to present a photo identification before casting a ballot.

The administration warned that voter ID laws like Texas’s threaten to disenfranchise thousands of minority voters across the nation. And in Texas, that situation is especially dire, with many of those same voters already facing decreased representation thanks to Republicans’ redistricting schemes.

Voter ID laws have been shopped in numerous states by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative lobbying group funded by wealthy interests, which purports to write bills for lawmakers.

Republicans favor ID laws because they fear an orchestrated campaign of voter fraud could tip elections against them. There is, however, no evidence of widespread voter fraud occurring anywhere in the U.S.

Instead, ID laws have been empirically demonstrated to drive down the number of votes (PDF) cast for Democrats by minorities, students, the poor and the elderly, who are less likely to carry a photo ID.

Texas is one of a number of historically discriminatory jurisdictions required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to obtain preclearance before changing their voting laws. Because of that, any changes to its election laws must be approved as non-discriminatory by the DOJ before they’re implemented state-wide.","government","2",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - A data security breach at the Utah Health Department, believed to be the work of Eastern European hackers, has exposed 24,000 U.S. Medicaid files bearing names, Social Security numbers and other private information, state officials said on Wednesday.

The intrusion initially appeared to have affected claims representing at least 9 percent of the 260,000 clients of Medicaid in Utah. But because each file often contains information on more than one individual, the full extent of the breach is probably wider, officials said.

Medicaid is a federal-state program that helps pay for healthcare for the needy, the aged and disabled. The state determines eligibility and which services are covered, and the federal government reimburses a percentage of the state’s expenditures.

“At this point, efforts are focused on determining the number and identity of individual clients who may have had their information compromised during the breach,” the state Health and Technology Services departments said in a joint statement.

Investigators determined that the breach occurred last Friday, and “late Sunday someone started taking information off the server”, Health Department spokesman Tom Hudachko told Reuters.

Hudachko said the Technology Services Department notified state health officials Monday evening about the cyber attack.

Technology Services had recently moved the claims in question to a new server, allowing the hackers “to circumvent the server’s multi-layered security system,” according to officials.

“This attack, as much as we have been able to tell so far, was limited to this one particular server,” Hudachko said.

He said the cyber attack is believed to have originated in Eastern Europe, based on a suspicious Internet Protocol, or IP, address, but investigators are still trying to pinpoint the precise source.

“There are a couple of countries that they have been able to narrow it down to,” he said.

GRAVE CONCERNS
Utah state Senator Allen Christensen, who also is a practicing dentist, said each compromised claim is going to have two parties involved - both the recipient and the provider.

“I submit Medicaid claims myself. I’m probably included in that bunch,” he said. “There is a significant amount of information on there including my Social Security number and my employer identification number, my address and all the rest of the stuff.”

Christensen, chairman for the Utah State Health and Human Services Committee, expressed grave concerns over the impact on the Medicaid population in Utah and suggested the database was left vulnerable by human error.

“The security steps that normally should have been taken were not taken, and somebody simply failed to push a correct button, and that left it open so someone could hack into it,” he said.

State officials said they were examining all servers and reviewing policies and procedures to ensure effective security measures are in place.

“Obviously we will be most concerned with individuals who had their Social Security numbers compromised,” Hudachko said. The compromised files also contain individuals’ names, addresses and other private information.

State Health officials are urging all their Medicaid clients and providers to keep a wary eye on their bank accounts and other personal records. Customers whose Social Security numbers are found to have been compromised will receive free credit monitoring services, officials said.","government","5",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

Dropbox acknowledged the breach at the time it occurred, but it didn't disclose the full extent of the hack. Language used by then-VP of engineering, Aditya Agarwal, also seemed to point to the idea that Dropbox believed only emails were stolen in the attack.

A stolen password was also used to access an employee Dropbox account containing a project document with user email addresses. We believe this improper access is what led to the spam. We're sorry about this, and have put additional controls in place to help make sure it doesn't happen again.
Motherboard was originally provided the information by a company called Leakbase, which gained access to the dataset and sent it to Motherboard. According to Motherboard, it received files ""containing email addresses and hashed passwords for the Dropbox users."" The four files totaled 5GB in size, and Motherboard reported that a senior Dropbox employee confirmed the legitimacy of the data.

Citing Patrick Heim, head of trust and security for Dropbox, Motherboard noted that last week's password reset likely covered all users who would have been impacted by the breach. Additionally, no malicious activity has been discovered on the accounts, Dropbox told Motherboard.

Hopefully, the impact will be minimal, if there is any impact at all. As noted by several outlets, the passwords that were stolen were encrypted, so they will likely not be able to be used by the hackers.

If you are a user, especially if you have a business account--change your Dropbox password. Even if the passwords are encrypted, it's an easy step to take to protect yourself and your organization.

Perhaps the biggest lesson that enterprise users can learn from all of this is the importance of security hygiene for every employee. The initial 2012 hack occurred because a Dropbox employee was using the same password to log into their corporate account as they were on another site. That password was stolen from the other site, and used to access Dropbox's network. So, encourage your employees to not use the same password across multiple sites, and to change their password often.

The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers
A new report from Motherboard revealed that the 2012 Dropbox hack affected more than 68 million accounts, leaking email addresses and encrypted passwords.
The passwords were encrypted, and there doesn't seem to be any malicious activity happening on the affected accounts.

"103","Blizzard","14,000,000","2012","It's Official: Blizzard Hacked, Account Information Stolen

Blizzard has been hacked and account information has been stolen, the World of Warcraft and Diablo III developer and publisher reports.

Blizzard's Battle.net service has been hacked, according to the Diablo III developer.

In a security update at Blizzard's website, the company said that their security team discovered ""unauthorized and illegal access"" into their internal network.

An investigation which involves law enforcement and security experts is under way.

Here's what Blizzard knows so far:

At this point, no signs of financial information ""such as credit cards, billing addresses, or real names were compromised"" though the investigation is ongoing.
Data accessed includes ""a list of email addresses for global Battle.et users, outside of China."" Chinese servers and accounts are handled by a third party.

Also stolen were answers to personal security questions.
Hackers accessed ""information relating to Mobile and Dial-In Authenticators.""
Topping off the list, scrambled passwords were stolen as well.
Blizzard says that based on their assessment, this data alone is not enough to access accounts, though they are urging players to change their passwords and secret questions to be on the safe side.

Battle.net accounts for World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo may have been compromised.

Is this the logical outcome of a Real Money Auction House combined with an always-online requirement? Nathan Grayson thinks it might be:

""So then, it’s a pain, but odds are, most of you will remain unaffected. I’d be remiss, however, if I didn’t point out that this is yet another crack in the paper-and-ash armor of Blizzard’s online requirement – at least, when it comes to series that used to be playable entirely offline like Diablo. Yes, I’m beating a dead horse and then spending hundreds of hours farming it for more loot while complaining about a lack of endgame, but it needs to be said all the same. Believe me: no one (except maybe the hackers) is happy about this, but I imagine people who just wanted a single-player experience with no muss or fuss are the angriest of all.""

(It's phrases like paper-and-ash armor that keep me reading Grayson and Rock Paper Shotgun regularly, by the way.)

In any case, whatever the cause of these hacks, whatever the problems with these pieces of the Diablo III experience, I think Nathan is also correct to give Blizzard kudos for handling this the way they have so far. They have an extensive FAQ published for inquisitive players, and have a plan of action in place and ready to go. They've been transparent about the hack, and are working with law enforcement to make sure it's handled properly.

Maybe, just maybe, the game will eventually have its always-online requirement removed, though I'm honestly not sure how feasible that is, how much of the game itself is simply built to only function by accessing servers and whether there's any way to walk that back now.

I doubt we'll see an end to the RMAH, however. Which is too bad. The use of a real money auction house to generate revenue strikes me as both riskier and less fair to gamers than the much-loathed DLC model we've seen lately. I prefer DLC or, better still, full-blown expansion packs for games like Diablo (a franchise which has seen its fair share of top-notch expansion packs) because they keep player-to-player transactions out of the picture while adding new content and extending the life of the game.

I enjoyed Diablo III quite a bit more than many people I spoke to, but I'd much rather never enter an auction house and spend my money on new content.

What Diablo III truly needs, however, is for PvP to become a reality. This has its own share of possible issues, however. I'm not sure how Blizzard will balance PvP out in a world where purchasing the best items makes your character the most powerful. Pay-to-win is no fun; less fun still when it incentivizes hackers to break into your account.

I've reached out to Blizzard to ask them if any of these issues might be detracting from the game experience itself, and whether they have any plans to reexamine the online requirement and the RMAH and will update this post when I hear back.

I'm off to change my password now. I recommend you do the same.","tech","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, Fla., is notifying nearly 9,500 patients of an investigation into two former employees who inappropriately accessed patient information.

The workers, whose employment was terminated, may have sought to process false tax returns using the information, according to a statement posted Thursday on MHS' website (PDF). Information affected may have included names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. No medical records were taken, according to the statement.

The inappropriate access took place from 2011 to early 2012, and the five-hospital system first discovered the access on Jan. 27. ""Once law enforcement confirmed that we could notify our patients, we wanted to notify them as quickly as possible,"" the statement noted.

Twenty-four million Zappos customers are getting an unpleasant Sunday-evening surprise.

The Amazon-owned e-commerce firm has revealed that it was the target of a cyber attack that gained access to its internal network, including the accounts of 24 million of its users. Though the company says that no complete credit card numbers were revealed in the breach, the intruders may have accessed customers' names, e-mail addresses,  phone numbers, addresses, the last four digits of their credit card numbers, and encrypted passwords. Zappos says it's taken the precaution of resetting the passwords of all its customers and directing them to set a new password upon visiting the site.

""We were recently the victim of a cyber attack by a criminal who gained access to parts of our internal network and systems through one of our servers in Kentucky,"" chief executive Tony Hsieh wrote to Zappos employees in an email posted to the site, declining to offer more information about the breach. ""We are cooperating with law enforcement to undergo an exhaustive investigation.""

Even after choosing a new Zappos password, users should be careful to also change their passwords on any site where they've used a similar or identical password, in case Zappos' intruders are able to decrypt the scrambled passwords they've stolen. Zappos is also warning affected customers to watch out for phishing emails that will use their stolen email addresses to spoof official Zappos emails and ask for account credentials or financial details.

Hsieh wrote in his all-hands email that every employee at Zappos' Henderson, Nevada headquarters will be assisting in the customer response to the breach, and that the company will only be responding to emails rather than phone calls in its effort to answer the massive number of queries that it expects to receive.  ""We've spent over 12 years building our reputation, brand, and trust with our customers. It's painful to see us take so many steps back due to a single incident,"" he wrote in the email. ""I suppose the one saving grace is that the database that stores our customers' critical credit card and other payment data was not affected or accessed.""

The question-and-answer site informs users that some of their passwords may have been breached in a security intrusion.Formspring has suffered a security intrusion in which some of its user passwords may have been breached, the question-and-answer site warned today.

Formspring, which said it only learned of the network intrusion this morning, responded by disabling all users' passwords.

""We apologize for the inconvenience but prefer to play it safe and have asked all members to reset their passwords,"" Formspring founder and CEO Ade Olonoh said in a company blog post. ""Users will be prompted to change their passwords when they log back into Formspring. ""

A Formspring spokesperson told CNET that the company was tipped off to breach by someone who spotted about 420,000 hashed passwords posted to a security forum that appeared to come from Formspring.

""Once we were able to verify that the hashes were obtained from Formspring, we locked down our systems and began an investigation to determine the nature of the breach,"" Dorothee Fisher said. ""We found that someone had accessed into one of our development servers and was able to extract account information from a production database. We were able to immediately fix the hole and are reviewing our internal security policies and practices to help ensure that this never happens again.""

The San Francisco-based startup, which launched its site in 2009, announced earlier this year that it had nearly 28 million users.

In the blog's comments section, many dissatisfied users expressed a desire to have their accounts deleted, but a company representative assured them that their passwords had all been ""salted,"" a cryptography technique that makes it harder to uncover the actual password.

The blog went on to give users a tutorial in creating strong passwords -- a helpful reminder in the wake of more high-profile password thefts at LinkedIn, eHarmony, and Last.fm. Their users passwords were among approximately 8 million posted in two separate lists to hacker sites in early June.

Police said Sunday they have arrested two people for allegedly hacking into the network system of KT Corp., Korea's No.2 mobile carrier, and selling the data.

The 40-year-old suspect, identified only by his family name Choi, and another were accused of leaking personal information of about 8.7 million mobile phone subscribers from February until recently, the National Police Agency's cyber terror response team said.

Seven others were booked without physical detention on charges of buying the leaked data for telemarketing purposes.

The number of KT subscribers accounts for nearly half of the total mobile phone users in South Korea, one of the most wired countries in the world.

Police suspect the telemarketers used the data, which contained personal information of subscribers, their phones and monthly plans, to contact customers whose contracts are close to expiration or considered likely to change phone plans. Officials estimate the suspects earned at least 1 billion won (US$877,000) from the illegal marketing.

""It took nearly seven months to develop the hacking program and (the suspects) had very sophisticated hacking skills,"" an official at the cyber response team said.

KT apologized over the hacking incident, saying it has restored the leaked personal information and taken necessary steps to prevent further leakage.

New details have now emerged about the historical hack.

New details about a historical hack of music website Last.fm have come to light.

Last.fm, owned by CBS (which also owns ZDNet and sister website CNET), suffered a data breach in 2012, but details of the attack were not disclosed. Reports suggested the service had an estimated 40 million users at the time.

On Thursday, breach notification site LeakedSource, which obtained a copy of the database and posted details of the hack in a blog post, said more than 43.5 million accounts were stolen.

LeakedSource was able to confirm that usernames, email addresses, join date, and other internal records, such as newsletter sign-ups and ad-related data, were stolen in the breach

The database also contained hashed passwords, scrambled with the MD5 algorithm that nowadays is easy to crack. LeakedSource said that the algorithm is ""so insecure"" that it was able to decipher over 96 percent of passwords in just two hours.

CNET helps you make sense of the password fiasco that has hit LinkedIn, eHarmony, and Last.fm.

LastPass has created a site where people can check to see if their password for LinkedIn or eHarmony was among those posted to a hacker forum.
LastPass
Three companies have warned users in the last 24 hours that their customers' passwords appear to be floating around on the Internet, including on a Russian forum where hackers boasted about cracking them. I suspect more companies will follow suit.

Curious about what this all means to you? Read on.

What exactly happened? Earlier this week a file containing what looked like 6.5 million passwords and another with 1.5 million passwords was discovered on a Russian hacker forum on InsidePro.com, which offers password-cracking tools. Someone using the handle ""dwdm"" had posted the original list and asked others to help crack the passwords, according to a screenshot of the forum thread, which has since been taken offline. The passwords were not in plain text, but were obscured with a technique called ""hashing."" Strings in the passwords included references to LinkedIn and eHarmony, so security experts suspected that they were from those sites even before the companies confirmed yesterday that their users' passwords had been leaked. Today, Last.fm (which is owned by CBS, parent company of CNET) also announced that passwords used on its site were among those leaked.

What went wrong? The affected companies have not provided information about how their users' passwords got in the hands of malicious hackers. Only LinkedIn has so far provided any details on the method it used for protecting the passwords. LinkedIn says the passwords on its site were obscured using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

If the passwords were hashed, why aren't they secure? Security experts say LinkedIn's password hashes should have also been ""salted,"" using terminology that sounds more like we're talking about Southern cooking than cryptographic techniques. Hashed passwords that aren't salted can still be cracked using automated brute force tools that convert plain-text passwords into hashes and then check if the hash appears anywhere in the password file. So, for common passwords, such as ""12345"" or ""password,"" the hacker needs only to crack the code once to unlock the password for all of the accounts that use that same password. Salting adds another layer of protection by including a string of random characters to the passwords before they are hashed, so that each one has a unique hash. This means that a hacker will have to try to crack every user's password individually instead, even if there are a lot of duplicate passwords. This increases the amount of time and effort to crack the passwords.

The LinkedIn passwords had been hashed, but not salted, the company says. Because of the password leak, the company is now salting all the information that is in the database that stores passwords, according to a LinkedIn blog post from this afternoon that also says they have warned more users and contacted police about the breach. Last.fm and eHarmony, meanwhile, have not disclosed whether they hashed or salted the passwords used on their sites.

Why don't companies storing customer data use these standard cryptographic techniques? That's a good question. I asked Paul Kocher, president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, whether there was an economic or other disincentive and he said: ""There is no cost. It would take maybe 10 minutes of engineering time, if that."" And he speculated that the engineer that did the implementation just ""wasn't familiar with how most people do it."" I asked LinkedIn why they didn't salt the passwords before and was referred to these two blog posts: here and here, which don't answer the question.

In addition to inadequate cryptography, security experts say the companies should have fortified their networks better so hackers couldn't get in. The companies haven't disclosed how the passwords were compromised, but given the large number of accounts involved, it's likely someone broke into their servers, maybe by exploiting a vulnerability, and snatched the data as opposed to it being due to some successful, large-scale phishing attack.

Was my user name stolen too? Just because the user names associated with the passwords weren't posted to the hacker forum doesn't mean they weren't stolen too. In fact, account data such as user names and passwords are typically stored together, so it's highly likely the hackers know everything they need to log into the affected accounts. LinkedIn won't say whether user names were exposed, but says that e-mail addresses and passwords are used to log into accounts and that no e-mail log-ins associated with the passwords have been published, that they know of. Also, the company says it has not received any ""verified reports"" of unauthorized access to any member's account as a result of the breach.

What should I do? LinkedIn and eHarmony said they have disabled the passwords on affected accounts and will follow up with an e-mail that includes instructions for resetting the passwords. The LinkedIn e-mail will not include a link directly to the site, so users will have to access the site via a new browser window, the company said. This is because phishing e-mails often use links in e-mails. Phishing scammers are already exploiting consumer fears about the password breach and sending links to malicious sites in e-mails that look like they come from LinkedIn. Last.fm urged all of its users to log into the site and change their passwords on the settings page, and said it, too, will never send an e-mail with a direct link to update settings or ask for passwords. Personally, I would recommend changing your password if you use any of the sites that have issued warnings just in case. Just because your password isn't on the leaked lists doesn't mean it wasn't stolen, and security experts suspect that the lists aren't complete.

So, you've changed your password on the sites, don't relax just yet. If you recycled that password and used it on other accounts, you need to change it there too. Hackers know that people re-use passwords on multiple sites out of convenience. So when they know one password, they can easily check to see if you used it on another more critical site, such as a bank Web site. If your password is remotely similar on the other site, you should change it. It's not that hard to figure out that if you used ""123Linkedin"" you might also use ""123Paypal."" And if you are curious as to whether your password was compromised, LastPass, a password manager provider, has created a site where you can type in your password and see if it was on the leaked password lists.

I could write a very long story about choosing strong passwords (actually, I already have), but some basic tips are to choose a long one, say six characters at a minimum; avoid dictionary words and opt for a mix of lower-and upper-case letters, symbols and numbers; and change passwords every couple of months. If you wisely choose strong ones you probably won't be able to remember them all, so here are suggestions for tools that help you manage passwords. (My colleague Donna Tam also has recommendations from experts in this article.)

How do I know if a Web site is protecting my password in the event of a breach? ""You don't,"" said Ashkan Soltani, a security and privacy researcher. Most Web sites don't disclose what their security practices are, opting instead to assure people that they take ""reasonable steps"" to protect user privacy, he said. There are no minimum security standards that general Web sites are required to follow like there are for banks and other financial sites that handle cardholder information for the major credit card companies. Many Web sites that accept payments outsource the processing of the transactions to other firms that are then subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Outside of the PCI certification, there is no reliable seal-of-approval for security in particular that people can look at to decide whether to trust a Web site or not. Maybe if there are enough data breaches at these big Web sites that people use every day, people will start demanding that the companies boost their security measures and lawmakers will call for security standards. Maybe.

I have a premium membership. Should I be worried? LinkedIn spokeswoman O'Harra told CNET that ""to the best of our knowledge, no other personal information beyond the list of passwords was compromised."" It's unclear what the situation is at eHarmony and Last.fm, which also offer paid subscriptions. Representatives at those sites have not yet responded to questions. Security firm AVG has a good tip for protecting credit card data when using Web-based sites that might fall prey to hacking. ""If you subscribe to online services, such as LinkedIn's or another site's premium services, put aside a credit card just for online purchases so that once it's compromised, you can alert just the one credit card company of the breach,"" writes AVG security evangelist Tony Anscombe in a blog post. ""Do not use an ATM card for such purchases as you may lose access to cash anywhere from a few hours to a few days.""

Besides my password, what other information in my account is sensitive? Hackers may have already used the compromised passwords to access at least some of the accounts. Once in, a hacker could pose as the account holder and send messages to others on the site, as well as find out your e-mail and other contact information if you provided it in your profile, along with names of your contacts and contents of messages sent between you and others that might contain sensitive information. There is a plethora of information there that can be used to target you with social engineering attacks, and even fodder that could be helpful for conducting corporate espionage because of the professional focus of the LinkedIn social-networking site.","tech","1",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"
"112","Gamigo","8,000,000","2012","Eight Million Email Addresses And Passwords Spilled From Gaming Site Gamigo Months After Hacker Breach

Call it a slow leak. Four months after the gaming site Gamigo warned users about a hacker intrusion that accessed some portions of its users' credentials, more than 8 million usernames, emails and and encrypted passwords from the site have been published on the Web, according to the data breach alert service PwnedList. The half-gigabyte collection of stolen user data was posted to the password-cracking forum Inside Pro earlier this month, where it remained online until late last week.

PwnedList founder Steve Thomas downloaded the file prior to its removal from the Web and has shared it with me, and I can confirm that it appears to be an enormous list of user emails with passwords obscured by cryptographic hashes.

""It's the largest leak I've ever actually seen,"" says Thomas, whose startup seeks to track data breaches and alert users when their information is published. ""When this breach originally happened, the data wasn't released, so it wasn't a big concern. Now eight million email addresses and passwords have been online, live data for any hacker to see.""


Gamigo users can check on PwnedList's site whether their email address is included in the leak.

Though the passwords weren't posted in a readable form initially, they may still be compromised. Within a half hour, another user in the Inside Pro forum thread responded to the post of the file with a message reading ""found 94%,"" implying that the passwords may have been easily derived from their hashed form.
Gamigo, a free gaming site owned by German publishing firm Axel Springer AG, forced all users to change their passwords after it announced it had been hacked in March of this year, so the exposed passwords likely won't give anyone access to user accounts on Gamigo.com itself. But given that users very often re-use passwords between sites, the breached passwords could offer access to more sensitive accounts on email or banking sites. Anyone who has had an account with Gamigo prior to its March breach should be sure to change their passwords on any accounts where they used the same credentials as on Gamigo.com.

According to PwnedList's analysis, the spilled data includes 3 million American accounts including Hotmail, Gmail, and Yahoo! mail addresses, 2.4 million German accounts, and 1.3 million French accounts. The company found dozens of email addresses from corporations including IBM, Allianz, Siemens, Deutsche Bank, and ExxonMobil.

Though the user who posted the file to Inside Pro counted 11 million hashed passwords, PwnedList's Thomas says he found only 8,244,o00 unique email addresses in the file. More than five thousand of the email addresses included the word ""gamigo,"" a sign that they were created specifically to register for Gamigo and strong evidence that the stolen database was in fact taken from Gamigo's servers.

In early March, Gamigo warned users that its ""database was subject to an attack in the last few days,"" and that ""the intruder(s) managed to acquire (alias) user names and encrypted gamigo user passwords."" A few hundred of those credentials were posted in Gamigo forums.

""We cannot rule out that the intruder(s) is/are still in possession of additional personal data, although to date we have received no report of any fraudulent use,"" read the message. ""To prevent any unauthorized access to your account, we have reset all passwords for the gamigo Account System and for all gamigo games!""

I've contacted Gamigo for comment, and will add any update from the company when I hear back.

Update: Gamigo has responded in a statement that while it did experience a breach in March, it has not confirmed that all 8 million passwords were in fact taken from Gamigo, and that as far as it can tell, ""the published records contain no new data.""

Its statement continues:

All necessary measures to minimize the impact of the attack were initiated immediately at that time. This included notification of all affected users, resetting of passwords, taking the hacked database offline, a thorough review of the company's IT security policies, removal of a portion of the company's offerings from the internet, notification of the relevant civil authorities and a clarification of

the ensuing legal questions.

The republication of the stolen data serves as a strong reminder of the need for vigilance and ongoing critical review of our procedures and policies.

PwnedList's Steve Thomas says he believes Gamigo hasn't acted irresponsibly in responding to the breach, despite not warning users to change any passwords they reused across other accounts. But he emphasizes that users who do reuse passwords should act now to change them immediately.

A group of hackers claiming to be the reborn Lulz Security (LulzSec) took credit for an alleged compromise of MilitarySingles.com, a dating website for military personnel, and the leak of over 160,000 account details from its database.

The group announced the MilitarySingles.com hack on Twitter and Pastebin on Sunday, using the name ""LulzSec Reborn"" and ASCII art previously associated with LulzSec, the hacker group that apparently disbanded and merged with the Anonymous hacktivist collective last year.

The Pastebin post included links to RAR archives hosted on public file sharing websites that allegedly contain the names, usernames, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, and passwords of 163,792 MilitarySingles.com users. ""There are emails such as @us.army.mil ; @carney.navy.mil ; @greatlakes.cnet.navy.mil ; @microsoft.com ; etc.,"" the group wrote.

Someone claiming to be the administrator of MilitarySingles.com posted a comment on databreaches.net after the site reported on the breach, saying that there is no evidence of a compromise.

The comment also suggested that ESingles, the company which runs the dating website, is nevertheless investigating the claims and taking the necessary security precautions.

The message annoyed members of ""LulzSec Reborn"" who, in response, called the administrator ""stupid"" and uploaded a ""hacked by"" page to the website in order to prove that they have access to it.

ESingles didn't immediately return a request for comment.

The directory in which the rogue page was uploaded is unprotected and appears to contain internal files associated with the site's content management software. If the credentials used for the database connection are available in one of those files, it would make stealing the user information fairly easy.

The original LulzSec hacker group took credit for many high-profile attacks during the spring of 2011. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies worldwide have since arrested several individuals believed to have been associated with the group. At the beginning of March it was revealed in official court records that LulzSec's alleged leader, a hacker known online as Sabu, has been working as a cooperating witness with the FBI since August 2011.

The rebirth of LulzSec seems to be the hacktivist community's response to Sabu's perceived betrayal of their cause and the arrests that resulted from his cooperation with the authorities. The LulzSec Reborn Twitter account was created on March 9 and was accompanied by videos posted on YouTube announcing the group's return on the hacking scene.

This isn't the only hack that Lulsec Reborn has claimed: On Monday, the group said it had compromised csscorp.com, the website of a San Jose-based information and communication technology company called CSS Corp.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Hacking group posts 1 million of the identifiers to the Web after allegedly lifting the data from an agent's laptop.

An online hacker group associated with Anonymous claims to have posted 1 million Apple Unique Device Identifiers (UDIDs) by breaching FBI security.

A UDID is the unique string of numbers that identifies each iOS device, formerly used by developers to track their app installations across Apple's user base.

In all, AntiSec claims to have obtained more than 12 million UDIDs, including user names, addresses, and notification tokens from a laptop used by an FBI agent. In a missive posted to Pastebin, the hacking group explains how it obtained the data from an FBI agent's laptop:

During the second week of March 2012, a Dell Vostro notebook, used by Supervisor Special Agent Christopher K. Stangl from FBI Regional Cyber Action Team and New York FBI Office Evidence Response Team was breached using the AtomicReferenceArray vulnerability on Java, during the shell session some files were downloaded from his Desktop folder one of them with the name of ""NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv"" turned to be a list of 12,367,232 Apple iOS devices including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, name of device, type of device, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, zipcodes, cellphone numbers, addresses, etc. the personal details fields referring to people appears many times empty leaving the whole list incompleted on many parts. no other file on the same folder makes mention about this list or its purpose.
Although Apple has already said it would begin restricting developer access to the identifiers, the Pastebin post says the group posted the data out of suspicion the FBI was using the UDIDs for nefarious purposes, such has people tracking, as well as to protest the use of UDIDs in general.

We always thought it was a really bad idea. that hardware coded IDs for devices concept should be erradicated from any device on the market in the future.
Even though it says it has more than 12 million UDIDs, AntiSec says it settled on posting only 1 million, trimming out personal information such as full names, cell numbers, and addresses.

We left those main columns we consider enough to help a significant amount of users to look if their devices are listed there or not. the DevTokens are included for those mobile hackers who could figure out some use from the dataset.

"115","Greek government","9,000,000","2012","Hacker arrested for allegedly stealing ID info of most of Greece
A computer programmer has been arrested in Greece for allegedly stealing the identity information of most of the country's population.

Reuters reports that the 35-year-old was found in possession of ""nine million data files containing identification card data, addresses, tax ID numbers and licence plate numbers"", which he was also suspected of trying to sell. The man's occupation has lead the police to suspect that he obtained the information through hacking, but some kind of accomplice working in government hasn't been ruled out.

Nine million individual files sounds like a lot. If true, it means that more than 83 percent of Greeks have had their personal information stolen. However, it's not quite that simple -- the police have pointed out that much of the information is duplicated, which isn't surprising. One ""data file"" might have someone's name and address, while another might have their name, address and tax ID number, for instance. Two files, one victim.


Also, Greece's unique political and geographical situation means it's hard to pin down exactly how many Greeks there are. The last

census, in 2011, recorded a population of 10,787,690. That includes both native Greeks and foreign immigrants now living in the country, but since Greece is, for many people, the easiest way into the EU, it also has a relatively large population of illegal immigrants. While most of the information in the databases will be from legal residents (Greek or otherwise) there are going to be some people without the legal right to residence who have also been victims of the ID theft.

Putting an exact figure to the number of people who have had their information stolen is therefore not possible right now, but it's still likely that a majority of Greeks are now victims of identity theft. Interestingly, while ID cards in the UK were scrapped in part because of the fear that having a single national database for the information of all citizens, Greek ID cards contain a bare minimum of information and don't rely on a unified database. That the information found in the man's possession came from such a wide range of sources might mean that keeping everything in separate databases isn't going to be as good at preventing cybercrime as some have hoped.","government","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

Approximately 3.6 million Social Security numbers and 387,000 credit and debit card numbers belonging to South Carolina taxpayers were exposed after a server at the state's Department of Revenue was breached by an international hacker, state officials said Friday.

All but 16,000 of the credit and debit card numbers were encrypted, the officials said.

The state's Department of Revenue became aware of the breach Oct. 10 and an investigation revealed the hacker had stolen the data in mid-September, after probing the system for vulnerabilities in late August and early September.

The vulnerability exploited by the attacker was closed Oct. 20.

During a press conference Friday, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley described the attack as international and ""creative in nature.""

Asked if she knew where the attack originated from, she said she does but declined to name the location because it might hurt the law enforcement investigation. She did, however, say she wants the hacker ""slammed to the wall.""

""We want to make sure everybody understands that our State will respond with a big, large-scale plan that is somewhat unprecedented to take care of this problem,"" Haley said.

The state will provide affected taxpayers with a year of credit monitoring and identity theft protection service from Experian.

""Anyone who has filed a South Carolina tax return since 1998 is urged to visit protectmyid.com/scdor or call 1- 866-578-5422 to determine if their information is affected,"" the Department said.

""While details are still emerging, we can already say that this breach of records at the South Carolina Department of Revenue (SCDOR) is exceptional, both in terms of the large number of records compromised and the potential damage to confidence in state government that may result,"" Stephen Cobb, a security evangelist at security firm ESET, said via email Friday.

""The cost is also going to be enormous, given that South Carolina may be required to pay for identity theft protection services for anyone who has paid taxes in South Carolina since 1998,"" he said.

""Encryption of the data may slow down the process by which the stolen records are converted into cash through identity theft and fraudulent accounts, although that will also depend on the strength of the encryption,"" Cobb said.

Cobb pointed out that this breach came only a couple of months before people can start filing their income tax returns.

""Fraudulent electronic claims for refunds are a huge problem for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as criminals can easily make fake versions of the income tax withholding form known as W-2, showing that the employer withheld more tax than was owed,"" Cobb said.

A giant case shows Russian hacker gangs remain a potent force, and provides fuel to arguments for mandatory sharing of computer attack information between industry and government.

A record-smashing, long-running data breach that involved 160 milllion credit and debit card numbers—stolen from Heartland Payment Systems, 7-Eleven, Carrefour, JC Penney, Hannaford, Wet Seal, Commidea, Dexia, JetBlue, Dow Jones, Euronet, Visa Jordan, Global Payment, Diners Singapore and Ingenicard—is likely to buttress the arguments for greater sharing of computer security information between companies and law enforcement agencies.

In announcing indictments Thursday, a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, Paul Fishman, called it “the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the United States.”

Given that we’ve been reading about these massive breaches for years, it’s hard to see where existing security protections are really working.  House Republicans have been pushing a cybersecurity bill, known by the acronym CISPA, aimed at breaking down barriers to sharing intelligence on cyber threats between businesses, government, and law enforment.  But the bill, which the House passed earlier this year, allows private businesses to share customers’ personal information with government agencies, including the National Security Agency.  President Obama has threatened to veto it, but hasn’t needed to.  The Senate didn’t pass it, so it never reached his desk.

While Washington is as paralyzed as ever, cyber-criminal gangs are anything but.   The indictments are a reminder that while there’s been plenty of evidence of Chinese involvement in data-thefts, (see “Expose of Chinese Data Thieves Reveals Soppy Tactics,” ) it’s hard to top Russian criminal networks when it comes to straight-on cybercrime (see “Moore’s Outlaws”).

We have heard the well-publicized stories of stolen laptops and resulting violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and we generally recognize the inherent security risks and potential for breach of unsecured electronic protected health information posed by computer hard drives. We remember to “wipe” the personal data off of our phones or computers before they are disposed, donated, or recycled.

A recent HIPAA settlement offers a costly reminder that other types of office equipment we use regularly have similar hard drives capable of storing confidential personal information.

On August 14, 2013, HHS announced a $1,215,780 settlement with the not-for-profit managed care plan Affinity Health Plan, Inc., stemming from an investigation of potential violations of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules relating to an April 15, 2010 breach report filed by Affinity with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Affinity’s breach report and OCR’s subsequent investigation revealed that Affinity had impermissibly disclosed the protected health information of up to 344,579 individuals when it returned multiple photocopiers to leasing agents without erasing the photocopier hard drives. Affinity learned of the breach when a representative from CBS Evening News informed the New York health plan that, as part of an investigatory report, CBS had purchased a photocopier previously leased by Affinity and had found confidential medical information on the photocopier’s hard drive. OCR’s investigation indicated that Affinity had failed to assess the potential security risks and implement policies for the disposal of protected health information stored on the photocopier hard drives.

In addition to the financial settlement, the Resolution Agreement includes a corrective action plan (CAP) requiring Affinity to use its “best efforts to retrieve all photocopier hard drives that were contained in photocopiers previously leased by [Affinity] that remain in the possession of [the leasing agent].” The CAP also requires Affinity to conduct a comprehensive risk analysis and implement safeguards to protect electronic protected health information on all of its electronic equipment and systems.

For more than ten years, digital copiers have been capable of storing images of documents. This settlement should serve as a warning to entities and individuals who handle electronic personal health information: any and all equipment capable of storing trace amounts of digital information should be accounted for in risk assessments conducted under the HIPAA Security Rule.  All HIPAA Privacy and Security Policies and Procedures Manuals should be updated to include guidelines for safeguarding protected health information retained on digital copiers, scanners, fax machines and other devices whose primary function may not be data storage.","healthcare","4",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"

The company has blamed the incident on software limitations

The personal information of 150,000 consumers who went into bankruptcy between 2007 and 2011 – including their social security numbers – were exposed after Citi failed to properly redact court records before they were put on the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system.

According to American Banker, Citigroup has blamed “limitations” in the piece of software responsible for redacting the documents.

“As a result of this limitation in technology, personally identifiable information could be exposed and read if electronic versions of the court records were accessed and downloaded from the courts' online docket system and if the person downloading the information had the technical knowledge and software to restore the redacted information,” the company stated.

When the incident was discovered in April 2011, Citi took immediate steps to remediate the issue. However, the US Justice Department’s US Trustee Program was unhappy with the fact that Citi failed to disclose the full extent of the breach.

In addition, the bank also failed to come up with a solution to the problem, and it did not promise to notify customers.

In a pact with US Trustee unsealed last week, Citi promised to notify all the impacted parties, offer a year of free credit monitoring, and redact the sensitive information at its own expense.","financial","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

The credentials included usernames, passwords and email addresses and were found by researchers at PwnedList.

About 40 million users or 60 percent of the site's total base registered before November 2009 were compromised when hackers broke into the site.

"121","Scribd","500,000","2013","Scribd, “world’s largest online library,” admits to network intrusion, password breach

San Francisco-based document sharing site Scribd has admitted to a network intrusion.

Scribd bills itself as The World’s Largest Online Library, and with a suggested 50 million users or more, it’s hardly surprising that the site has attracted the attention of cybercriminals.

Details are scant, but a notification published on the company’s online Support Desk states:
Earlier this week, Scribd's Operations team discovered and blocked suspicious activity on Scribd's network that appears to have been a deliberate attempt to access the email addresses and passwords of registered Scribd users.

Because of the way Scribd securely stores passwords, we believe that the passwords of less than 1% of our users were potentially compromised by this attack.

We have now emailed every user whose password was potentially compromised with details of the situation and instructions for resetting their password.

Therefore, if you did not receive an email from us, you are most likely unaffected.

The comment that less than 1% of users were potentially compromised “because of the way Scribd stores passwords” could probably have been made more clearly.

At first blush, I was inclined to interpret this to mean that 99% of passwords were stored securely, presumably by salting and hashing, leaving only a small proportion open to the scrutiny of intruders.

The good news, if you read on, is that it looks as though none of Scribd’s passwords are stored in cleartext, as the company goes on to say that:

Our investigation indicates that no content, payment and sales-related data, or other information were accessed or compromised. We believe the information accessed was limited to general user information, which includes usernames, emails, and encrypted passwords.

Scribd isn’t claiming any certainty in what was taken (the verb believe implies acceptance without proof), but that’s not unexpected.

Determining precisely what was stolen after an electronic break-in is tricky, and pedantic readers will be quick to point out that, technically, nothing was stolen because the original copies of the data remained behind.

Scribd also isn’t clarifying how the passwords were encrypted, and the company probably doesn’t actually mean encrypted, either.

Salting and hashing passwords is supposed to be a one-way process that allows the passwords to be verified, but not decrypted to reveal the original cleartext.

Assuming they were hashed and salted, then, stealing the password database doesn’t directly reveal anyone’s password.

But it does let the crooks mount an offline attack on the database, hashing a dictionary of passwords one-by-one and noticing when a guessed password is verified against the database of hashes.

And since Scribd isn’t saying what password security algorithm it used, you have little choice but to assume it was a hashing process that doesn’t slow down determined attackers much.

That’s why the following behaviours are important:

When you choose a password, don’t pick anything obvious. Attackers put the most likely passwords at the top of their dictionary lists, so the tougher your password, the later it will fall, if at all.
Don’t use the same password on multiple sites. Doing so means that your login details on the most important site are at risk from an attack on the least secure one.
If you store password databases, use a strong salt-and-hash system (e.g. bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2) that makes it much harder and slower for attackers to go through their password dictionary, but not so slow that it’s impracticable to verify individual passwords when your users login.
Scribd has put up an online “breach checker” which lets you check individual email addresses against the list of probably-pwned accounts:

It would have been a nice touch if the company had used HTTPS for this particular page, rather than sending your email address, and the notification of whether it was on the at-risk list, via unencrypted HTTP:

On the other hand, since anyone can check anyone’s email address anyway, and since you probably received an email advising you to change your password already if your account was potentially pwned, it probably doesn’t matter.

The Kissinger Cables comprise more than 1.7 million US diplomatic records for the period 1973 to 1976. Dating from January 1, 1973 to December 31, 1976 they cover a variety of diplomatic traffic including cables, intelligence reports and congressional correspondence. They include more than 320,000 originally classified records, including 286,000 full US diplomatic cables. There are more than 12,000 documents with the sensitive handling restriction ""NODIS"", 'no distribution', and more than 9,000 labelled ""Eyes Only"". Full cables originally classed as ""SECRET"" total more than 61,000 and ""CONFIDENTIAL"" more than 250,000.

The records were reviewed by the United States Department of State's systematic 25-year declassification process. At review, the records were assessed and either declassified or kept classified with some or all of the metadata records declassified. Both sets of records were then subject to an additional review by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Once believed to be releasable, they were placed as individual PDFs at the National Archives as part of their Central Foreign Policy Files collection. Despite the review process supposedly assessing documents after 25 years there are no diplomatic records later than 1976. The formal declassification and review process of these extremely valuable historical documents is therefore currently running 12 years late.

The form in which these documents were at NARA was 1.7 million individual PDFs. To prepare these documents for integration into the PlusD collection, WikiLeaks obtained and reverse-engineered all 1.7 million PDFs and performed a detailed analysis of individual fields, developed sophisticated technical systems to deal with the complex and voluminous data and corrected a great many errors introduced by NARA, the State Department or its diplomats, for example harmonizing the many different ways in which departments, capitals and people's names were spelled. All our corrective work is referenced and available from the links in the individual field descriptions on the PlusD text search interface: https://search.wikileaks.org/plusd. For more information on what WikiLeaks did to prepare the Kissinger Cables please see here.

Not all records from the period 1973-1976 have been obtained. NARA claims diplomatic records for the period 1973 to 1976 chosen for content deletion were of a ephemeral character. These records were identified by the ""TAGS"" that were attached to them. TAGS (""Traffic Analysis by Geography and Subject"") refers to the content tagging system implemented by the Department of State for its central foreign policy files in 1973. There are geographic, organization and subject TAGS. This system was developed to standardise search terms for departmental uses and was not static - TAGS were added and deleted as necessary over time. At review, all cables that only contained ""temporary"" TAGS, such as embassy logistical or staffing requests, were permanently destroyed.

Tens of thousands of documents were irreversibly corrupted in this data set due to technical errors when the documents were moved as computer systems were upgraded, or so the US Department of State claims. This caused the content of the document to be lost, though the metadata is still available. These are often noted by a error message in the content of the document. The documents lost in this manner are most documents from the following periods:

December 1, 1975 to December 15, 1975
March 8, 1976 to April 2, 1976
May 25, 1976 to July 1, 1976
You can see the absence of these weeks by constructing a Timegraph of ""TAGS"" as this term occurs in the content of nearly every document: http://search.wikileaks.org/plusd/graph#q=TAGS

Top Secret documents are also not available. During a migration of records the Department of State printed out all Top Secret documents for ""preservation purposes"" and the electronic versions were destroyed permanently. These documents now only exist as hardcopies and so are unavailable online in any form, even if declassified.

The documents not deleted either remained classified (or were deemed unreleasable for other reasons), or were declassified and publicly released. For the former, a ""withdrawal card"" was provided giving some limited metadata about the document, the fields of which that were decided as releasable vary from document to document. This metadata provides some information about the document, for example the date and destination, that can be used for research purposes and also allows a detailed FOIA request to be made for the document. These FOIA requests can be directed to NARA's Special Access and FOIA staff. For more information about this, please see their online guide here. You will need the document number and the To and From information.

There are nine different ""Types"" of document included in the Kissinger Cables. The majority are of type ""TE"" - telegram (cable), which are official diplomatic messages sent between embassies and the US Secretary of State conveying official information about policy proposals and implementation, program activities, or personnel and diplomatic post operations. From 1973 onwards diplomatic cables were mostly electronic, therefore most cables made releasable include the body (content) of the cable. However, the other types of documents are paper records, including airgrams and diplomatic notes. These are stored on microfilm (from 1974 onwards, as the Department of State did not microfilm documents until then) and so were not released with the full content of the documents, even if marked for public release. Although the body of the message is not available online the full index (metadata) is provided for those ""P-reel"" documents that were marked for release. Even though the whole document has not been digitised the metadata is still useful for research purposes and the documents can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act. For those documents on P-reel that were not declassified and released a P-reel ""withdrawal card"" is provided giving limited metadata. To access P-reel documents that have a withdrawal card you should follow the same FOIA procedure as for Telegram withdrawal cards. For the content of P-reel documents which have been released, the process depends slightly on which year the document you are requesting was created, but all requests should be directed to: archives2reference@nara.gov.","government","3",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

LivingSocial, the online offers site owned in largish part by Amazon, has just emailed its userbase, said to be 50,000,000-strong, to fess up to a data breach.

That’s right: another day, another shed-load of password hashes in the hands of crooks.

At least LivingSocial’s password database was salted and hashed, which reduces the impact of the breach a lot.

Naked Security reader Chris, from Melbourne, Australia, kindly sent us a copy of the notification email he received:
LivingSocial recently experienced a security breach on our computer systems that resulted in unauthorised access to some customer data from our servers. We are actively working with the authorities to investigate this issue.

The information accessed includes names, email addresses, the date of birth of some users, and encrypted passwords; technically 'hashed' and 'salted' passwords. We never store passwords in plain text.

To revise password storage quickly: don’t store the actual password.

Store a random string of characters instead, combine the password and this random string (that’s “salting” the string to vary its flavour), and pass the salted password through a non-reversible cryptographic function to get a message digest code (that’s “hashing” the data by slicing, dicing and stirring together the salted input in a digital mixing bowl).

A crook can check to see if your password is, say, s3cr3cy by salting-and-hashing himself, but he has to start with a guess, because he can’t go back from the hash to your password.

That’s why easy-to-guess passwords are bad: the crooks crack them first.
The silver lining I’m always determined to find when SNAFUs like this occur is that LivingSocial took the opportunity to sneak an additional, and pertinent, security reminder into its breach notification:

Please note that LivingSocial will never ask you directly for personal or account information in an email. We will always direct you to the LivingSocial website – and require you to login – before making any changes to your account. Please disregard any emails claiming to be from LivingSocial that request such information or direct you to a website that asks for such information.

Good advice, not least because cybercrooks love to take security announcements, from patches and updates to breach notifications, and use them to try to get new victims on the hook.

And it’s just when you’re expecting a notification from a company you do business with that you are at the greatest risk of believing emails that you’d probably discard out of hand at any other time.

That’s also good advice, but a few more words would have made it even better: if you’ve used the same password on multiple sites, change the passwords on those sites so that they are all different.

And if you are in the habit of re-using passwords, don’t wait until one of your accounts gets hacked before you go and change all those common passwords.

The whole idea of using different passwords on different sites is to avoid what you might call a “race to the bottom,” where all your logins end up as insecure as the slackest, sloppiest, weakest site on the list.

SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo, already reeling from its September disclosure that 500 million user accounts had been hacked in 2014, disclosed Wednesday that a different attack in 2013 compromised more than 1 billion accounts.

The two attacks are the largest known security breaches of one company’s computer network.

The newly disclosed 2013 attack involved sensitive user information, including names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and unencrypted security questions that could be used to reset a password. Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions — steps that it declined to take in September.

It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked.

The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.

Yahoo said it discovered the larger hacking after analyzing data files, provided by law enforcement, that an unnamed third party had claimed contained Yahoo information.

Security has taken a back seat at Yahoo in recent years, compared to Silicon Valley competitors like Google and Facebook. Yahoo’s security team clashed with top executives, including the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, over the cost and customer inconvenience of proposed security measures.

And critics say the company was slow to adopt aggressive security measures, even after a breach of over 450,000 accounts in 2012 and series of spam attacks — a mass mailing of unwanted messages — the following year.

“What’s most troubling is that this occurred so long ago, in August 2013, and no one saw any indication of a breach occurring until law enforcement came forward,” said Jay Kaplan, the chief executive of Synack, a security company. “Yahoo has a long way to go to catch up to these threats.”

Yahoo has made a steady trickle of disclosures about the 2014 hacking, which it has been investigating with the help of federal authorities. The company said Wednesday that it now believes the attacker in that breach, which it says was sponsored by a government, found a way to forge credentials to log into some users’ accounts without a password.


Bob Lord, Yahoo’s chief information security officer, said in a statement that the state-sponsored actor in the 2014 attack had stolen Yahoo’s proprietary source code. Outside forensics experts working with Yahoo believe that the state-sponsored hackers used Yahoo’s code to access user accounts without their passwords by creating forged “cookies,” short bits of text that a website can store on a user’s machine. By forging these cookies, attackers were able to impersonate valid users, gaining information and performing actions on behalf of their victims. The company has not disclosed who it believes was behind the attack.

In July, Yahoo agreed to sell its core businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. Verizon said in October that it might seek to renegotiate the terms of the transaction because of the hacking, which had not been disclosed to Verizon during the original deal talks.

After the latest disclosure Wednesday, a Verizon spokesman, Bob Varettoni, essentially repeated that position.

“As we’ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation,” he said. “We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.”

Mr. Lord said Yahoo had taken steps to strengthen Yahoo’s systems after the attacks. The company encouraged its users to change passwords associated with their Yahoo account and any other digital accounts tied to their Yahoo email and account.

In the hacking disclosed Wednesday, Mr. Lord said Yahoo believed an “unauthorized third party” managed to steal data from one billion Yahoo user accounts. Mr. Lord said that Yahoo had not been able to identify how the hackers breached Yahoo’s systems, but that the company believed the attack occurred in August 2013.

Changing Yahoo passwords will be just the start for many users. They will also have to comb through other services to make sure passwords used on those sites are not too similar to what they were using on Yahoo. And if they were not doing so already, they will have to treat everything they receive online, such as email, with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick them out of even more information.

Yahoo recommended that its customers use Yahoo Account Key, an authentication tool that verifies a user’s identity using a mobile phone and eliminates the need to use a password on Yahoo altogether.

Security experts say the latest discovery of a breach that happened so long ago is another black mark for the company. “It’s not just one sophisticated adversary that gets in,” said Ben Johnson, co-founder and chief security strategist at Carbon Black, a security company. “Typically companies get compromised multiple times due to the same vulnerability or employee culture.”

Mr. Johnson added that the scale of the breaches is only increasing as companies store more and more troves of information in similar databases. “When you have these huge databases of information, it’s millions — and now billions — of accounts lost,” he said.","tech","2",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Network_Based_Attack"

The usernames and phone numbers for 4.6 million Snapchat accounts have been downloaded by hackers, who temporarily posted the data online.

A website called SnapchatDB released the data but censored the last two digits of the phone numbers.

It has since been taken offline but a cached version is still available.

The hack comes days after an Australian firm, Gibson Security, warned of vulnerabilities in Snapchat's app which it said could be exploited by hackers.

Gibson Security said it was not involved in the hack: ""We know nothing about SnapchatDB, but it was a matter of time till something like that happened,"" the firm tweeted.

The hackers behind the website that published the data said they had exploited the security flaw highlighted by Gibson Security.

""We used a modified version of gibsonsec's exploit/method,"" they were quoted as saying by tech blog, Tech Crunch.

Stronger safeguards?
Snapchat has grown in popularity as an app that allows people to share pictures, safe in the knowledge they delete themselves after being viewed.

It has a feature called Find Friends, which allows users to upload their address book contacts to help find friends who are also using the service.

In its report published on 25 December, Gibson Security warned that a vulnerability on the Snapchat app could be used to reveal the phone numbers of users.

The firm said it had first warned Snapchat about this four months ago, adding that ""nothing had been really been improved upon"".

Vulnerability
Gibson claimed that it had been able to crunch through ten thousand phone numbers of Snapchat users ""in approximately 7 minutes on a gigabit line on a virtual server"".

In response to the Gibson report, Snapchat acknowledged a potential vulnerability but said it had taken measures to protect user data.

""Theoretically, if someone were able to upload a huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an area code, or every possible number in the US, they could create a database of the results and match usernames to phone numbers that way,"" it said in a blogpost last week.

""Over the past year we've implemented various safeguards to make it more difficult to do. We recently added additional counter-measures and continue to make improvements to combat spam and abuse.""

However, the hackers behind the SnapchatDB, the site that published the phone numbers, said the measures were not strong enough.

""Even now the exploit persists. It is still possible to scrape this data on a large scale,"" they claimed.

""Their latest changes are still not too hard to circumvent.""","tech","2",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

UD experiences IT security breach, provides free services, resources for those affected

UPDATE: 3 p.m., Aug. 19, 2013--The University of Delaware has concluded its investigation into the July data security breach. The investigation determined that more than 74,000 individuals were affected, among them fewer than 2,000 not in the initial group of current and past employees. The second group includes individuals who have received some payment from the University. They were sent notification letters on August 16 offering the same credit-monitoring and protection services as the initial group.

9:30 a.m., July 30, 2013--The University of Delaware is notifying the campus community that it has experienced a cyberattack in which files were taken that included confidential personal information of current and past employees, including student employees. A criminal attack on one of the University’s systems took advantage of a vulnerability in software acquired from a vendor.

The University sent notification letters dated July 29, 2013, to more than 72,000 affected persons and offered them free credit monitoring. Approximately one-third have active UD email accounts and will have received an email notification as well.

The confidential personal information includes names, addresses, UD IDs (employee identification numbers) and Social Security numbers.

Individuals with UDelNet IDs and passwords can check to see they are affected by this incident by using the IT Security Verification application on a special IT Security Response website.  

The University took immediate corrective actions and is working closely with Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and Mandiant, a leading private computer security firm, on the issue. The University continues to investigate the scope of the attack. While this forensic investigation is underway, the University is taking steps to protect itself from future cyberattacks.

The University has retained the services of Kroll Advisory Solutions, a global leader in risk mitigation and response that will provide free credit monitoring services to the employees whose information was compromised. Affected individuals who want to take advantage of the services will receive instructions on how to do so in their notification letter.

Some email messages from Kroll Advisory Solutions were diverted into recipients' spam, junk or trash folders, and persons who think they might be affected should check there. Kroll's licensed investigators are available from 9 a.m.-8 p.m., Monday through Friday, through Aug. 30. After Aug. 30, telephone hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m., Monday through Friday. Those affected are reminded that the coverage extends three years from the date of notification and that they have six months to enroll in the free service. To contact Kroll Advisory Solutions, call 1-877-309-0016.

Twitter is coming forward as the latest site to be hacked. The social network said in a blog post Friday afternoon that approximately 250,000 user accounts were potentially compromised, with attackers gaining access to information including user names and email addresses.
The company first detected signs of an attack earlier in the week, which led to an investigation and the discovery of a larger breach.
""This week, we detected unusual access patterns that led to us identifying unauthorized access attempts to Twitter user data. We discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later,"" said Bob Lord, Twitter's director of information security, in a post. ""However, our investigation has thus far indicated that the attackers may have had access to limited user information.""
Twitter has reset the passwords and revoked session tokens, which allow you to stay logged into the service without reentering a password, for all of these accounts. Affected users will not be able to log in and will receive an e-mail instructing them to reset their password. The post doesn't go into details about the methods the attackers used, but does refer to a recent Java vulnerability. The Department of Homeland Security recently warned users about the issue and suggested they disable Java in their browsers unless ""it is absolutely necessary.""
This attack follows major security breaches at the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, which were both attributed to Chinese hackers. The New York Times suspects it was in response to negative coverage of the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, and the Journal said evidence pointed to an attempt to ""target the monitoring of the Journal's coverage of China.""
The Washington Post announced late Friday that it too had experienced attacks that fit the profile in 2011, and Bloomberg News acknowledged that it was targeted but said no computers were compromised.
While the Twitter post does not mention China or blame the hacks on any specific country or group, it does mention the news organization hacks.
""This attack was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident. The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked,"" said Lord.
A quarter-million accounts is a small segment of Twitter's 200 million monthly active users worldwide. However the company offers tips for all of its users going forward, including using strong passwords that mix numbers and symbols with upper- and lowercase letters, not using the same password for multiple accounts, and disabling Java.","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

A Walgreens healthcare company has notified patients and employees of a data breach after computer hardware and other paper records containing the personal health information and Social Security numbers of patients was stolen. 

Anaheim, Calif.-based Crescent Healthcare mailed out letters to patients and employees Feb. 21, notifying them of the theft which occurred Dec. 28, 2012. According to the letter, an unknown person or persons broke into Crescent's billing center and stole the hardware, which may have contained patient names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, health insurance data, dates of birth and clinical diagnoses. The group notified authorities three days later. 

""We are very sorry this happened, and we are cooperating with law enforcement to further investigate this incident,"" writes Paul Mastrapa, president of Crescent Healthcare, in the letter.

The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice says it “strives to increase public safety by reducing juvenile delinquency, strengthening families and turning around the lives of troubled youth.”  Creating more trouble for youth and their families is obviously not part of their mission, yet that’s what may have happened.  From a press release they issued yesterday:


The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) today reported an information security breach to FDLE, due to the possibility of identity theft.

On Jan. 2, DJJ reported the theft of a mobile device containing youth and employee records to the Tallahassee Police Department (TPD), which is currently investigating the theft. DJJ has also notified the Office of Information Security.

The device, which was stolen from a secure DJJ office, was not encrypted or password-protected as required by DJJ’s technology policy.

“This is an unacceptable lapse that could potentially expose youth and employees to identity theft,” stated Secretary Wansley Walters. “We are working to determine who may be affected by the breach and make sure that all other devices with confidential information are properly protected. We are partnering with TPD to track down the stolen device and have reached out to FDLE.”

DJJ confirms that more than 100,000 records may have been compromised, and the agency is currently working to determine the affected individuals. DJJ is working to notify those youth and employees who may be affected, once they are determined.

DJJ issued emails with a policy reminder and prospective security instructions to all employees and contracted provider programs requiring the immediate encryption of all mobile devices that are not already protected and contain confidential data.

For information on preventing and recovering from identity theft, please visit the Florida Attorney General Identity Theft webpage or the Federal Trade Commission identity theft webpage, or call1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338).

This may not be the department’s first “unacceptable lapse.” In September 2012, a small item in the Orlando Sentinel reported that three computers “containing sensitive Department of Juvenile Justice information” were stolen.  The theft, which  occurred at the Boca Club apartments, was reported to and by the Orlando Police, who would not reveal any other details citing the ongoing investigation. Why three computers with sensitive DJJ information were at that location was never explained, and I found no follow-up on the theft report.

August 27, 2013 - Advocate Medical Group of Chicago is in the process of alerting more than 4 million patients of a July 15 data breach in which four unencrypted computers were stolen from a Park Ridge administrative building. This substantial breach is the second-largest HIPAA violation ever reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Though no health data was compromised, patient names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dates of birth were exposed, according to the Chicago Tribune. Affected patients include those who received treatment as far back as the 1990s. Advocate Medical Group is the largest Chicago physician group, with more than 1,000 doctors and 200 locations, mostly in Chicagoland and central Illinois.

The administrative building had a security camera and panic button, but didn’t have an alarm or security personnel and the computers have yet to be recovered. Advocate said it plans on reassessing its security approaches going forward.

Kelly Jo Golson, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Advocate Health Care, said it took the organization a month to determine the depth of the breach.

“There was a large volume of data on the computers, and the format of the data was very complex,” Golson said. “We were very comprehensive and thorough in our analysis of the data to ensure we were notifying every patient who may be affected.”

Advocate started notifying patients of the breach on Friday and will continue doing so until Sept. 9 while offering a free year of credit monitoring services to affected patients. “Nothing leads us to believe the computers were taken for the information they contain, and there is no information to suggest any of that data has been used in an inappropriate way,” Golson said. “We want our patients to know that security is a top priority, and we’re focused right now on putting together resources to make sure we can help answer any questions.”

The problem here, as is the case on most incidents, is the lack of encryption and reliance on password protection as means of securing patient data. Whether they’re responsible for 4 million patients’ data or just a handful, organizations need to start taking encryption seriously.","healthcare","2",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Lost_or_Stolen_Device"
"132","Apple","275,000","2013","Apple Developer site hack: Turkish security researcher claims responsibility
 This article is more than 6 years old
Turkish security researcher claims to have found flaw in system, which has been offline since Thursday as company 'rebuilds and strengthens' security around databases


Apple says its Developer portal has been hacked and that some information about its 275,000 registered third-party developers who use it may have been stolen.

The portal at developer.apple.com had been offline since Thursday without explanation, raising speculation among developers first that it had suffered a disastrous database crash, and then that it had been hacked.

A Turkish security researcher, Ibrahim Balic, claims that he was behind the ""hack"" but insisted that his intention was to demonstrate that Apple's system was leaking user information. He posted a video on Youtube which appears to show that the site was vulnerable to an attack, but adding ""I have reported all the bugs I found to the company and waited for approval."" A screenshot in the video showed a bug filed on 19 July - the same day the site was taken down - saying ""Data leaks user information. I think you should fix it as soon as possible.""

The video appears to show developer names and IDs. However, a number of the emails belong to long-deprecated services, including Demon, Freeserve and Mindspring. The Guardian is trying to contact the alleged owners of the emails.

Balic told the Guardian: ""My intention was not attacking. In total I found 13 bugs and reported [them] directly one by one to Apple straight away. Just after my reporting [the] dev center got closed. I have not heard anything from them, and they announced that they got attacked. My aim was to report bugs and collect the datas [sic] for the purpose of seeing how deep I can go with it.""

Apple said in an email to developers late on Sunday night that ""an intruder attempted to secure personal information of our registered developers… [and] we have not been able to rule out the possibility that some developers' names, mailing addresses and/or email addresses may have been accessed.""

It didn't give any indication of who carried out the attack, or what their purpose might have been. Apple said it is ""completely overhauling our developer systems, updating our server software, and rebuilding our entire database [of developer information].""

Some people reported that they had received password resets against their Apple ID - used by developers to access the portal - suggesting that the hacker or hackers had managed to copy some key details and were trying to exploit them.

If they managed to successfully break into a developer's ID, they might be able to upload malicious apps to the App Store. Apple said however that the hack did not lead to access to developer code.

The breach is the first known against any of Apple's web services. It has hundreds of millions of users of its iTunes and App Store e-commerce systems. Those systems do not appear to have been affected: Apple says that they are completely separate and remained safe.

Apple's Developer portal lets developers download new versions of the Mac OS X and iOS 7 betas, set up new devices so they can run the beta software and access forums to discuss problems. A related service for developers using the same user emails and passwords, iTunes Connect, lets developers upload new versions of apps to the App Store. While developers could log into that service, they could not find or update apps and could not communicate with Apple.

But if the hack provided access to developer IDs which could then be exploited through phishing attacks, there would be a danger that apps could be compromised. Apps are uploaded to the App Store in a completed form - so hackers could not download ""pieces"" of an existing app - and undergo a review before being made publicly available.

High-profile companies are increasingly the target of increasingly skilful hackers. In April 2011, Sony abruptly shut down its PlayStation Network used by 77 million users and kept it offline for seven days so that it could carry out forensic security testing, after being hit by hackers - who have never been identified.

It has also become a risk of business for larger companies and small ones alike. On Saturday, the Ubuntu forums were hacked, and all of the passwords for the thousands of users stolen - although they were encrypted. On Sunday, the hacking collective Anonymous said that it hacked the Nauruan government's website.

On Sunday, the Apple Store, used to sell its physical products, was briefly unavailable - reinforcing suspicions that the company was carrying out a wide-ranging security check. The company has not commented on the reasons for the store going down.

Marco Arment, a high-profile app developer, noted on his blog before Apple confirmed the hack that "" I don't know anything about [Apple's] infrastructure, but for a web service to be down this long with so little communication, most 'maintenance' or migration theories become very unlikely.""

He suggested that the problem could either be ""severe data loss"" in which restoring from backups has failed - but added that the downtime ""is pretty long even for backup-restoring troubles"" - or else ""a security breach, followed by cleanup and increases defenses"".

Of the downtime, he said ""the longer it goes, especially with no statements to the contrary, the more this [hacking hypothesis] becomes the most likely explanation.""","tech","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cyber-criminals targeted Nasdaq OMX Group’s community forum website and gained access to the email usernames and passwords of the members of the site, which took two days to come back online on Thursday evening.

The New York-based exchange operator said in an emailed letter to users of the forum that no e-commerce or transactions of any kind were taking place on the website. The forum was open to the general public to join.

Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat could not say how many people’s information may have been compromised.

The cyber-attack happened on Tuesday, the same day a report was released saying that around half of the world’s securities exchanges had been targeted by cyber-attacks last year.

Cyber-crime appears to on the rise both in terms of sophistication and complexity, widening the potential for infiltration and large-scale damage, the report, by the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ research department and the World Federation of Exchanges Office, said.

A major attack could result in widespread public mistrust and a retreat from the markets, it added.

On Thursday, Wall Street firms, along with exchanges and regulators, held a simulated cyber-attack in order to help participants prepare to combat the real thing. The drill, named Quantum Dawn 2, was organized by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Nasdaq said in the letter to its forum users that it was upgrading and restoring the forum website, where users can discuss issues such as market moves.

The exchange said all passwords expired and asked that members update any other accounts that may have the same passwords.

Nasdaq has been targeted by cyber crime in the past. In 2010, hackers infiltrated the exchange’s computer systems and installed software that allowed them to spy on the directors of publicly held companies, Reuters reported.

And last year in February, Nasdaq and Kansas-based exchange operator BATS Global Markets said they were hit by denial of service attacks, which seek to disrupt websites and computer systems by overwhelming the targeted organizations’ networks with computer traffic.

In October 2011, NYSE Euronext’s New York Stock Exchange website was inaccessible for 30 minutes, according to an Internet monitoring company, but the exchange said there was no interruption of service.","financial","1",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

Ubisoft has suffered a security breach and is warning account holders that details have been compromised.

The video games publisher said that user names, email addresses and encrypted passwords had been ""illegally accessed"", but that subscribers' debit and credit card details remained safe as it did not store them.

The firm said it had 58 million people on its database at the time of attack.

It said it did not believe the attack was related to earlier breaches.

Last year the firm had to release an emergency patch after it discovered a security hole in its Uplay web browser add-on could have allowed cybercriminals to run malware on computers that had installed it.

Then in April it temporarily halted sales of PC video games after hackers discovered a way to download software from its online store without paying and stole a copy of a title it had yet to release.

'Strengthen measures'
""We are recommending all our users change their passwords,"" the firm said in a statement.

""We also recommend that you change your password on any other website or service where you use the same or a similar password.

""Ubisoft's security teams are exploring all available means to expand and strengthen our security measures in order to better protect our customers. Unfortunately, no company or organisation is completely immune to these kinds of criminal attacks.""

France-based Ubisoft is best known for its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance, Splinter Cell and Far Cry franchises.

Gamers buying its titles for PCs are often required to register an account with the firm as an anti-piracy measure, while console owners are encouraged to do so in order to log ""achievements"" which can be used to unlock bonus content.

The attack comes two years after the biggest video games industry breach to date - a hack attack on Sony's PlayStation network that resulted in millions of subscribers' passwords and credit card details being leaked online.

The firm was later fined £250,000 by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which criticised the Japanese company for failing to have up-to-date security software.","tech","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"
"135","Ubuntu","2,000,000","2013","Hack exposes e-mail addresses, password data for 2 million Ubuntu Forum users
Ubuntu maintainer Canonical exhorts users to change passwords immediately.

E-mail addresses, user names, and password data for every registered user of the Ubuntu Forums—estimated to be 1.82 million accounts—were exposed in a security breach hitting the company responsible for maintaining the freely available, open-source operating system. There's no sign the compromised data has been published online.

The Ubuntu Forums were closed Saturday evening following the discovery that the site's homepage was defaced by someone who managed to gain privileged access to its underlying servers. To their credit, administrators with Canonical, the for-profit company that markets Ubuntu, quickly issued an advisory that warned users who used their forum password to safeguard other accounts to change the credentials immediately. The forums remained inaccessible at time of writing on Sunday afternoon.

""While the passwords were not stored in plain text, good practice dictates that users should assume the passwords have been accessed and change them,"" Ubuntu CEO Jane Silber wrote in an updated advisory. ""If users used the same password on other services, they should immediately change that password.""

In an e-mail, Silber told Ars the passwords were cryptographically scrambled using the MD5 hashing algorithm, along with a per-user cryptographic salt. While the scheme is the standard protection provided by VBulletin, the Web software used on the Ubuntu forums, password experts consider MD5 with or without salt to be an inadequate means of protecting stored passwords. While per-user salt slows down the time it takes to crack large numbers of passwords in unison, it does little to nothing to delay the cracking of small numbers of hashes. That means the scheme used by Canonical doesn't prevent the decoding of individual hashes that may be targeted because of the attractiveness of the specific user it belongs to—a high-ranking executive, for instance, or people whose e-mail addresses belong to Fortune-500 domains.

As Ars has explained repeatedly, a far more robust password-storage scheme involves the use of bcrypt, scrypt, or another ""slow"" hashing algorithm. By increasing the time and computing resources required to convert plain-text passwords into hashes, these slow algorithms require crackers to spend months, years, or even centuries to decipher hashes, compared with days or weeks for salted hashes generated with MD5, SHA1 and other fast algorithms. The protection provided by slow hashing algorithms also extends to single hashes, unlike the protection afforded by salting. These enhanced protections are important in scenarios of database breaches, which allow people to perform offline cracking attacks and then use the results to breach accounts that use those credentials elsewhere.

While it's disappointing that Canonical chose a relatively weak hashing scheme to protect its forum users' passwords, company officials deserve credit for immediately reporting the breach and exhorting users to change passwords. By contrast, recent responses to password breaches hitting Reputation.com and LivingSocial.com either made no suggestion to change passwords or played down that advice.

So far, there's no indication the password hashes and other data exposed in the Ubuntu forums hack have been published online, but it wouldn't be surprising for that to change. The person responsible for the hack went to the trouble of defacing the forum homepage. To get maximum publicity, the individual may decide to air some or all of the data acquired. And with the Internet Archive recently estimating 1.82 million registered Ubuntu forum accounts, the potential for abuse is high.

As always, Ars readers are encouraged to use a password manager and choose a long, randomly generated passcode that's unique for each important site. For a deeper dive on passwords in general, see last year's feature Why passwords have never been weaker—and crackers have never been stronger.

Game console maker's Web site with 4 million members in Japan was breached and personal data such as e-mail addresses exposed, but the company did not confirm if the information had been misused.

Ninetendo's member Web site has been breached and personal information of its customers in Japan may have been exposed, according to the company.

A report by The Japan Times on Saturday cited a statement by the game console and software maker which revealed about 15.46 million fradulent login attempts were launched against the site from June 9, 2013, through to Thursday last week. Of these, 23,926 were eventually successful, it said.

Data affected by the hacks included names, home addressses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of its 4 million Club Nintendo members in Japan, the company said.

Nintendo, however, did not confirm any misuse of the breached data. It had suspended the affected accounts and passwords used in the unauthorized access, and was contacting members whose data might have been illegally accessed and requesting that they changed their passwords.

The Club service is offered to registered Nintendo's customers who have purchased the company's consoles and software, allowing them to earn points which can be redeemed for rewards such as CDs.

In June 2013, The Guardian reported the first leak based on top-secret documents that then 29-year-old Edward Snowden stole from the National Security Agency. At the time, Snowden worked as an intelligence contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.

That leak would certainly not be the last. In the years since, journalists have released more than 7,000 top-secret documents that Snowden entrusted them with, which some believe is less than 1% of the entire archive.

Now, with the film ""Snowden"" premiering Friday, it's worth taking a look back at what secrets Snowden actually revealed. We've compiled every single leak that came out in the first year of the Snowden saga, though there were many more that came later.

Snowden downloaded up to 1.5 million files, according to national intelligence officials, before jetting from Hawaii to Hong Kong to meet with journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. After he handed off his treasure trove of documents, he flew from Hong Kong and later became stranded in Moscow. His future was far from certain, as the journalists he trusted started revealing his secrets.

Here is everything that Snowden's leaks revealed between 2013 and 2014:

"138","Facebook","6,000,000","2013","Important Message from Facebook's White Hat Program
At Facebook, we take people’s privacy seriously, and we strive to protect people’s information to the very best of our ability. We implement many safeguards, hire the brightest engineers and train them to ensure we have only high-quality code behind the scenes of your Facebook experiences. We even have teams that focus exclusively on preventing and fixing privacy-related technical issues before they affect you.



Even with a strong team, no company can ensure 100% prevention of bugs, and in rare cases we don’t discover a problem until it has already affected a person’s account. This is one of the reasons we also have a White Hat program to collaborate with external security researchers and help us ensure that we maintain the highest security standards for our users.



We recently received a report to our White Hat program regarding a bug that may have allowed some of a person’s contact information (email or phone number) to be accessed by people who either had some contact information about that person or some connection to them. 



Describing what caused the bug can get pretty technical, but we want to explain how it happened. When people upload their contact lists or address books to Facebook, we try to match that data with the contact information of other people on Facebook in order to generate friend recommendations. For example, we don’t want to recommend that people invite contacts to join Facebook if those contacts are already on Facebook; instead, we want to recommend that they invite those contacts to be their friends on Facebook. 



Because of the bug, some of the information used to make friend recommendations and reduce the number of invitations we send was inadvertently stored in association with people’s contact information as part of their account on Facebook. As a result, if a person went to download an archive of their Facebook account through our Download Your Information (DYI) tool, they may have been provided with additional email addresses or telephone numbers for their contacts or people with whom they have some connection. This contact information was provided by other people on Facebook and was not necessarily accurate, but was inadvertently included with the contacts of the person using the DYI tool. 



After review and confirmation of the bug by our security team, we immediately disabled the DYI tool to fix the problem and were able to turn the tool back on the next day once we were satisfied that the problem had been fixed.



We've concluded that approximately 6 million Facebook users had email addresses or telephone numbers shared. There were other email addresses or telephone numbers included in the downloads, but they were not connected to any Facebook users or even names of individuals. For almost all of the email addresses or telephone numbers impacted, each individual email address or telephone number was only included in a download once or twice. This means, in almost all cases, an email address or telephone number was only exposed to one person. Additionally, no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook – not developers or advertisers – have access to the DYI tool.



We currently have no evidence that this bug has been exploited maliciously and we have not received complaints from users or seen anomalous behavior on the tool or site to suggest wrongdoing. Although the practical impact of this bug is likely to be minimal since any email address or phone number that was shared was shared with people who already had some of that contact information anyway, or who had some connection to one another, it's still something we're upset and embarrassed by, and we'll work doubly hard to make sure nothing like this happens again. Your trust is the most important asset we have, and we are committed to improving our safety procedures and keeping your information safe and secure.



We have already notified our regulators in the US, Canada and Europe, and we are in the process of notifying affected users via email.



We appreciate the security researcher's report to our White Hat program, and have paid out a bug bounty to thank him for his efforts.

Evernote is asking its millions of users to reset their passwords following an attempt to hack the note-taking network.

In a blog post acknowledging the security breach Evernote's chief technology officer, Dave Engberg, explained that usernames and email addresses had been accessed along with encrypted password information. ""The individual(s) responsible were able to gain access to Evernote user information, which includes usernames, email addresses associated with Evernote accounts and encrypted passwords,"" said Engberg.

The hack attempt sees Evernote join the growing list of companies who have been forced to report security breaches in recent months including Microsoft, Facebook and Apple. However, without further details it's impossible to say whether the attack followed a similar pattern -- malicious software on employee computers -- or whether it was a separate incident. Wired.co.uk's request for comment had not been answered at the time of publication.


Despite the enforced password reset, Engberg was at pains to point out the data was still in a protected format: ""Even though this information was accessed, the passwords stored by Evernote are protected by one-way encryption. (In technical terms, they are hashed and salted)"" he said. The global password reset representing ""an abundance of caution"" rather than an immediate threat to user security.

Evernote's monitoring reportedly found no evidence that payment information for users of the business or premium services was tampered with but added that it was ""constantly enhancing the security of our service infrastructure to protect Evernote and your content.""

"142","Drupal","1,000,000","2013","Drupal.org resets login credentials after hack exposes password data
Passwords for almost one million accounts on the Drupal.org website are being reset after hackers gained unauthorized access to sensitive user data.

Drupal.org is the official website for the popular open-source content management platform. The breach is the result of an attack that exploited a vulnerability in an undisclosed third-party application and not in Drupal itself, according to Holly Ross, executive director of the Drupal Association, in a blog post published Wednesday. The hack exposed usernames, e-mail addresses, country information, and cryptographically hashed passwords, although investigators may discover additional types of information were compromised.

""Malicious files were placed on association.drupal.org servers via a third-party application used by that site,"" Ross wrote. ""Upon discovering the files during a security audit, we shut down the association.drupal.org website to mitigate any possible ongoing security issues related to the files. The Drupal Security Team then began forensic evaluations and discovered that user account information had been accessed via this vulnerability.""

There's no indication credit card data was intercepted. There's also no evidence that any unauthorized changes were made to Drupal source code or projects.

Drupal.org administrators have responded by rebuilding production, staging, and development systems and enhancing most servers with grsecurity, a set of security patches for the Linux operating system. The admins have also hardened their configuration of the Apache Web server application and added antivirus scanning to their security routine. Some Dupal.org subsites, particularly those with older content, have been converted to static archives so they can't be updated in the future.

Drupal.org account holders will be required to change their password by visiting this link, entering their username or e-mail address, and following the link included in the e-mail message that follows. Ross also encouraged account holders to change login credentials on other sites that used the same or a similar password used on Drupal.org.

Most of the passwords stored by Drupal.org were both salted and, more importantly, passed through a cryptographic hash function multiple times using the open-source phpass application. Some older passwords weren't salted. If Drupal engineers followed good practices—and there's no indication they didn't—the repeated hash iterations will go a long way towards preventing anyone who obtains the data from quickly cracking the hashes and exposing the underlying plaintext that generated them. (Cryptographic salting, which appends unique characters to each password before it's hashed, is also helpful, although people frequently overstate the protection it provides. For much more on password protection see the Ars feature Anatomy of a hack: How crackers ransack passwords like “qeadzcwrsfxv1331”.)

Ross didn't identify the exploited third-party application. Given Drupal.org's use of Apache, it's possible the site was compromised by the same attack that has plagued at least 20,000 other sites in recent weeks. Researchers still don't know how attackers are gaining almost unfettered, ""root"" access on these servers, but the same backdoor, often known as Linux/Cdorked, more recently started compromising sites that run on the nginx and Lighttpd Web servers too.

The hacks are underscoring the growing vulnerability of websites to serious malware attacks. On Tuesday, evidence emerged that servers running the Ruby on Rails framework were being compromised and made part of a botnet. The attackers in that case were exploiting an extremely critical vulnerability that was patched in early January.

Drupal's front page states there are 967,545 people in 228 countries (speaking 181 languages) using the platform.

Journalists discovered that two companies had posted the personal data of 170,000 customers online. The leak, which exposed the victims to identity theft and fraud, was reportedly so bad that social security numbers, passport scans, financial data and home addresses were indexed by search engines. Rather than merely address the problem, however, TerraCom and YourTel threatened the reporters, referring to them as “hackers” and accusing them of “numerous violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.”

Slate:

David Giles, Scripps’ deputy general counsel, responded to the accusation that the reporters “hacked” the information by calling on the companies to stop the “name calling and the legal posturing” and instead address the “apparent careless security practices” raised by the story. “Regardless of the flowery moniker you have used to characterize the bureau's newsgathering activities, the bureau's reporters have not violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or any other law or regulation,” Giles wrote in a letter sent to TerraCom and YourTel’s lawyers earlier this month.

It's interesting how readily many of us pattern-recognize this as a classic ""hacker tragedy,"" whereby clueless stupids kill the messenger who was trying to help them. But it seems simpler than that, to me: is this not simply a case of criminals breaking data protection laws in pursuit of their own convenience, then threatening the people who caught them?

See, for example, this part of the legal nastygram they sent to the journos:

""Because the Scripps Hackers have put the Companies in the position of having to incur the costs of potentially complying with more than 20 state data breach notification laws, the Companies are likely to look to Scripps to reimburse them for those costs.""

"144","Washington State court system","160,000","2013","Washington State system hacked, data of thousands at risk
SEATTLE (Reuters) - The website for the Washington State court system has been hacked and up to 160,000 Social Security numbers and a million driver’s license numbers may have been accessed, officials said on Thursday.
The disclosure, which follows a number of major hacking incidents in recent years that have targeted a range of companies from Twitter to Apple Inc, raises concerns that the information accessed could be used to commit financial fraud.

The breach was discovered in February, and officials at first believed no confidential information had been leaked even though a large amount of data was downloaded from the website, the Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts said.

But officials later determined that 94 Social Security numbers were definitely obtained by the person or group that committed the security breach, while 160,000 Social Security numbers and a million driver’s license numbers may have been accessed.

“The access occurred through a ‘back door’ part of a commercial software product we were using, and it is patched now,” Mike Keeling, information technology operations and maintenance manager for the court system, told reporters on a conference call.

“We found specific (hacker) footprints in the area where those 94 Social Security numbers were located, so that’s why we’re reasonably sure that the data was accessed,” he said.

Callie T. Dietz, the state’s court administrator, said this was the first time the agency’s system had been hacked. Officials were notifying by mail the 94 people whose Social Security numbers were accessed from the site.

“We regret that this breach has occurred and we have taken immediate action to enhance the security of these sites,” Dietz said separately in a statement.

The people whose names and Social Security numbers might be at risk are those who were booked into a city or county jail in the state from September 2011 to December 2012, officials said.

The breach could also have exposed the driver’s license numbers of people charged in the state’s superior court criminal system between 2011 and 2012, the statement said.

Anyone who received a driving under the influence citation from 1989 to 2011 or had a traffic case filed or resolved in a district or municipal court between 2011 and 2012 might also be at risk, officials said.

No financial data such as credit card numbers was maintained on the court website, so officials said there was no risk of that information being accessed directly through the breach.

The breach was the latest in a series of hacks. In one prominent case, Cody Kretsinger of LulzSec, an offshoot of hacking group Anonymous, last year pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles to taking part in a computer breach of Sony Pictures Entertainment that prosecutors say caused over $600,000 in damages. Last month, he was sentenced in California to a year in prison.

MacRumors user forums have been breached by hackers who may have acquired cryptographically protected passwords belonging to all 860,000 users, one of the top editors of the news website said Tuesday evening. ""In situations like this, it's best to assume that your MacRumors Forum username, e-mail address and (hashed) password is now known,"" Editorial Director Arnold Kim wrote in a short advisory. He went on to advise users to change their passwords for their MacRumors accounts and any other website accounts that were protected by the same passcode.

The MacRumors intrusion involved ""a moderator account being logged into by the hacker who then was able to escalate their privileges with the goals of stealing user login credentials,"" Kim said. The company is still investigating how the attacker managed to compromise the privileged account. ""We're not sure how the original moderator's password was obtained, but it seems like they just logged in with it,"" Kim wrote in an e-mail to Ars. ""We are looking into it further to see if there was another exploit, but there hasn't been any evidence of it yet."" Kim also told Ars that log files examined so far seem to indicate the intruder ""tried to access"" the password database. At this early stage, there are no indications that the passwords, either in cryptographically hashed or cracked format, are circulating online. There's also no sign that the hackers were able to access any other data than that belonging to the use forums.


Kim went on to compare the hack to one that hit Ubuntu forums in July. The Ubuntu breach exposed cryptographically hashed password data for an estimated 1.82 million users to hackers who went on to deface the site's home page. Like the Ubuntu forums, MacRumors used the MD5 algorithm, along with a per-user cryptographic salt, to convert plain-text passwords into a one-way hash.

The scheme is the standard protection provided by VBulletin, the Web software used on both the Ubuntu and MacRumors forums. Still, many password experts consider the MD5 with or without salt to be an inadequate means of protecting stored passwords. They say that while per-user salt slows down the time it takes to crack large numbers of passwords in unison, it does little or nothing to delay the cracking of small numbers of hashes. That means the scheme deployed by MacRumors does nothing to prevent the decoding of individual hashes that may be targeted because of the attractiveness of the specific user it belongs to -- a high-ranking executive or celebrity, for instance, or people whose e-mail addresses belong to Fortune-500 domains.

Some MacRumors account holders have reported compromises affecting accounts they have on other sites, although at this early stage it's impossible to know if that's linked to the MacRumors security breach.

Readers who had MacRumors accounts would do well to follow Kim's advice and immediately change login credentials that use the same or similar password. They should also be vigilant of phishing attempts, since their user names and e-mail addresses have also been exposed.","tech","1",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"
"146","Court Ventures","200,000,000","2013","Senator Intensifies Probe of Data Brokers
A Congressional probe into the multibillion-dollar data brokerage industry – companies that collect, analyze, sell or share personal details about consumers for marketing purposes – is intensifying.

On Wednesday afternoon, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat, sent a letter to Donald Robert, the chief executive of Experian, asking for information about a company subsidiary, called Court Ventures, that sold sensitive consumer data, allegedly to an identity theft service in Vietnam.

Senator Rockefeller is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which last year began investigating the practices of nine leading data brokers including Experian, a credit bureau that also offers marketing and fraud prevention services.

“The committee’s investigation has focused to date on how companies including Experian collect and sell consumer information for marketing purposes, while the information Experian reportedly sold to identity thieves – such as Social Security numbers and banking information – appears to be data Experian collects and sells for risk assessment activities,” Mr. Rockefeller wrote in the letter to Mr. Robert. “However, if these recent news accounts are accurate, they raise serious questions about whether Experian as a company has appropriate practices in place for vetting its customers and sharing sensitive consumer data with them, regardless of the particular line of business.”

Mr. Rockefeller’s letter is part of a larger effort by the Commerce Committee to understand how companies collect, share and sell intimate details about the shopping habits, health concerns, family circumstances and financial status of consumers at a time when Americans are increasingly sharing personal information online.

The letter cited an article by KrebsOnSecurity.com, an Internet security news site, which published a report Sunday on the alleged sale of sensitive data by Court Ventures to the Web site Superget.info, whose administrators were based in Vietnam.

The report said that Court Ventures had signed a data-sharing agreement with another information services firm, called U.S. Info Search, and that Court Ventures had resold the other company’s data to Superget.info.

Last week, the Department of Justice announced an indictment against one of the administrators of the Superget.info site, a Vietnamese national named Hieu Minh Ngo. Among other allegations, the indictment charges him with conspiracy to commit identity fraud and aggravated identity theft.

Experian bought Court Ventures, described on Experian.com as an aggregator that repackages and resells electronically available public records data “obtained from more than 1,400 state and county sources,” in 2012.

In a statement, Gerry Tschopp, a spokesman for Experian, said: “After the acquisition, the U.S. Secret Service notified Experian that Court Ventures had been and was reselling data from U.S. Info Search to a third party that the U.S. Secret Service was investigating as possibly engaged in illegal activity. Following the notice by the U.S. Secret Service, Experian discontinued reselling U.S. Info Search data and worked closely and in full cooperation with law enforcement to bring Vietnamese national Hieu Minh Ngo, the alleged perpetrator, to justice.”

He added that “no Experian database was accessed” and that the suspect in the case had obtained access to the data before Experian acquired the company.

Experian, which reported revenue of $4.73 billion in its 2013 fiscal year, had already come under scrutiny by Mr. Rockefeller before the news reports this week.

Last year, the senator asked data brokers including Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and Reed Elsevier, which owns the Lexis-Nexis database, to provide a list of all sources from which the companies obtained information on consumers; a list of the types of details the companies collected about consumers; and a list of the services and data they offer to third parties.

One data broker, for instance, estimated that more than 250,000 Web sites apprise consumers that they share data with third parties.

But, according to Mr. Rockefeller’s letter to Mr. Robert, Experian to date has “refused to fully respond” to the Commerce Committee’s request for the identities of Experian’s sources of consumer data and the purchasers of that data.

Mr. Tschopp, the Experian spokesman, said: “We have responded — and will continue to respond – in a very transparent manner to Senator Rockefeller.”

Last month, Mr. Rockefeller widened his probe, asking a dozen popular Web sites to provide information on their information-sharing practices with data brokers. The sites included About.com, Babycenter.com, Bankrate.com, Health.com, Investopedia.com, Mensfitness.com and Self.com.

“While some consumers may not object to having their information categorized and used for marketing,” Mr. Rockefeller wrote to executives at the sites, “before they share personal information, it is important that they know it may be used for purposes beyond those for which they originally provided it.”","financial","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

Vodafone Germany said on Thursday that an attacker with insider knowledge had stolen the personal data of two million of its customers from a server located in Germany.

“This criminal attack appears to have been executed by an individual working inside Vodafone,” the company said in a statement provided to SecurityWeek. “An individual has been identified by the police and their assets have been seized.”

The data accessed by the attacker includes customer names, addresses, gender, birth dates, bank account numbers and bank sort codes, the telecommunications giant said.

Vodafone LogoVodafone said credit card numbers, passwords, PINs, and mobile phone numbers were not exposed. No personal call information or browsing data was accessed by the attacker.

The company said the attack was discovered on September 5, but said authorities had requested that the breach remained under wraps while an investigation was conducted.

German news agency DPA reported that the suspect had worked for a contractor of the company and was not a Vodafone employee.

""This attack was only possible with high criminal energy, insider knowledge and found hidden deep in the company's IT infrastructure instead,"" Vodafone Deutschland said in an online statement translated from German.

The breach is limited to customers in Germany who will be notified by mail.

Because the attack was conducted with insider knowledge, the company said it changed the passwords and certificates of all administrators, and completely re-installed (wiped) the affected server for security reasons.

The phone company did warn customers about possible Phishing attacks stemming from the breach, which could be used as a means to gather passwords and credit card information from customers.

Given the fact that the attackers have significant amounts of personal information, they have the ability to create highly customized phishing emails that could look legitimate.

Vodafone advised customers to take caution when receiving telephone or e-mail inquiries in which they are asked to hand over personal information such as passwords or credit card information.

“We have instructed independent security experts to advise on the potential implications for the individuals affected so we can offer them advice and take the best action to help them,” the company said. “In the absence of passwords, PINs or credit card details it is very unlikely that criminals would gain direct access to an individual’s bank account. However, there is a heightened risk that the criminals may request a fake direct debit application which would be immediately visible to the account holder and which could be immediately blocked or reversed under well-established banking protection measures.”

Vodafone said it would take all necessary steps to further improve the security of its systems to protect them from future criminal attacks.

This incident, along with recent headlines created by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, remind us that the insider threat is alive and well. However, while insiders are an important threat to protect against, Verizon's 2013 Data Breach Incident Report (DBIR) showed that insiders accounted for only 14 percent of the data breaches included in the report.

Earlier this month, Verizon agreed to pay $130 billion to buy Vodafone out of its 45 percent stake in Verizon's U.S. wireless business.","telecoms","3",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"

"149","D&B, Altegrity","1,000,000","2013","LexisNexis, Dunn & Bradstreet, Kroll hacked
Three major U.S. data brokerages -- companies that amass and sell sensitive data -- have been hit by a hacking group that specializes in selling stolen social security numbers.

The breaches at LexisNexis, Dun & Bradstreet and Kroll Background America were disclosed by cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs on KrebsOnSecurity.

Krebs reports that a cybercrime ring associated with the cyberunderground website ssndob.ms is responsible. SSNDOB stands for social security number date of birth.

It should come as no surprise that data thieves target data brokers. These companies make big profits by systematically assembling names, addresses, property records and vital statistics. After tapping free public sources for such data, data brokers turn around and sell the data to employers, lawyers, realtors, police, even jealous spouses.

Background: How data brokers' practices spawned data loss disclosure laws

An FBI spokeswoman told the Reuters news service that it was investigating but did not elaborate. Krebs reports that the gang snuck malicious software onto servers at LexisNexis as early as April 2013.

Gary Alterson, senior director of Risk and Advisory Services at risk management consultancy Neohapsis, said it is common for large organizations to fail to detect network intruders for months at a time.

""Most security diligence isn't actually that diligent – they're compliance based,"" Alterson says. ""Typically, companies answer a questionnaire or get interviewed. There's no in-depth assessment of the actual effectiveness of security controls which, at the end of the day, is what matters.""

Pat Peterson, CEO of messaging security firm Agari, says the cybercriminals most likely stole terabytes of data from D&B, LexisNexis and Kroll Background America, a division of Altegrity.

The SSNDOB gang , Peterson says, is most interested in selling social security numbers, birthdays, mother's maiden names, and similar data to other criminals who specialize in various forms of identity theft.

The gang also likely will sell other miscellaneous data stolen from the data brokers to anyone willing to make a bid. Those include criminals who specialize in targeted attacks that leverage knowledge about a specific victim's acquaintances and preferences.

""While we don't yet know whose data has been compromised, millions of Americans are now at risk as the criminals knit the stolen data together with their attacks to go after identity theft and bank accounts,"" Peterson says.""Think of it as stealing a car and selling the parts. They will find someone to purchase this data. We're talking about names of spouses, children and other family members; information on where they went to school, their hometowns, etc. ""

Andreas Baumhof, chief technology officer atThreatMetrix, observes that breaches on companies that amass sensitive data have become commonplace.

""There are two types ofcompanies. Those that have been hacked and know it and those that have beenhacked and don't know it,"" Baumhof says.

Too many companies still concern themselves with security as an after-thought, he says.

""I know so many chief information security officers who arefighting to get a budget to do the right thing, but it's hard to justifya budget if you haven't had a breach,"" Baumhof says.

An identity theft service that sells Social Security numbers, birth records, credit and background reports on millions of Americans has infiltrated computers at some of America’s largest consumer and business data aggregators, according to a seven-month investigation by KrebsOnSecurity.

ssndobhomeThe Web site ssndob[dot]ms (hereafter referred to simply as SSNDOB) has for the past two years marketed itself on underground cybercrime forums as a reliable and affordable service that customers can use to look up SSNs, birthdays and other personal data on any U.S. resident. Prices range from 50 cents to $2.50 per record, and from $5 to $15 for credit and background checks. Customers pay for their subscriptions using largely unregulated and anonymous virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin and WebMoney.

Until very recently, the source of the data sold by SSNDOB has remained a mystery. That mystery began to unravel in March 2013, when teenage hackers allegedly associated with the hacktivist group UGNazi showed just how deeply the service’s access went. The young hackers used SSNDOB to collect data for exposed.su, a Web site that listed the SSNs, birthdays, phone numbers, current and previous addresses for dozens of top celebrities — such as performers Beyonce, Kanye West and Jay Z — as well as prominent public figures, including First Lady Michelle Obama, CIA Director John Brennan, and then-FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Earlier this summer, SSNDOB was compromised by multiple attackers, its own database plundered. A copy of the SSNDOB database was exhaustively reviewed by KrebsOnSecurity.com. The database shows that the site’s 1,300 customers have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars looking up SSNs, birthdays, drivers license records, and obtaining unauthorized credit and background reports on more than four million Americans.

Frustratingly, the SSNDOB database did not list the sources of that stolen information; it merely indicated that the data was being drawn from a number of different places designated only as “DB1,” “DB2,” and so on.

But late last month, an analysis of the networks, network activity and credentials used by SSNDOB administrators indicate that these individuals also were responsible for operating a small but very potent botnet — a collection of hacked computers that are controlled remotely by attackers. This botnet appears to have been in direct communications with internal systems at several large data brokers in the United States.  The botnet’s Web-based interface (portions of which are shown below) indicated that the miscreants behind this ID theft service controlled at least five infected systems at different U.S.-based consumer and business data aggregators.

DATA-BROKER BOTNET
Two of the hacked servers were inside the networks of Atlanta, Ga.-based LexisNexis Inc., a company that according to Wikipedia maintains the world’s largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information. Contacted about the findings, LexisNexis confirmed that the two systems listed in the botnet interface were public-facing LexisNexis Web servers that had been compromised.

One of two bots connected to SSNDOB that was inside of LexisNexis.

The botnet’s online dashboard for the LexisNexis systems shows that a tiny unauthorized program called “nbc.exe” was placed on the servers as far back as April 10, 2013, suggesting the intruders have had access to the company’s internal networks for at least the past five months. The program was designed to open an encrypted channel of communications from within LexisNexis’s internal systems to the botnet controller on the public Internet.

Two other compromised systems were located inside the networks of Dun & Bradstreet, a Short Hills, New Jersey data aggregator that licenses information on businesses and corporations for use in credit decisions, business-to-business marketing and supply chain management. According to the date on the files listed in the botnet administration panel, those machines were compromised at least as far back as March 27, 2013.

The fifth server compromised as part of this botnet was located at Internet addresses assigned to Kroll Background America, Inc., a company that provides employment background, drug and health screening. Kroll Background America is now part of HireRight, a background-checking firm managed by the Falls Church, Va.-based holding company Altegrity, which owns both the Kroll and HireRight properties. Files left behind by intruders into the company’s internal network suggest the HireRight breach extends back to at least June 2013.

An initial analysis of the malicious bot program installed on the hacked servers reveals that it was carefully engineered to avoid detection by antivirus tools. A review of the bot malware in early September using Virustotal.com — which scrutinizes submitted files for signs of malicious behavior by scanning them with antivirus software from nearly four dozen security firms simultaneously — gave it a clean bill of health: none of the 46 top anti-malware tools on the market today detected it as malicious (as of publication, the malware is currently detected by 6 out of 46 anti-malware tools at Virustotal).


ASSESSING THE DAMAGE

All three victim companies said they are working with federal authorities and third-party forensics firms in the early stages of determining how far the breaches extend, and whether indeed any sensitive information was accessed and exfiltrated from their networks.

For its part, LexisNexis confirmed that the compromises appear to have begun in April of this year, but said it found “no evidence that customer or consumer data were reached or retrieved,” via the hacked systems. The company indicated that it was still in the process of investigating whether other systems on its network may have been compromised by the intrusion.

“Immediately upon becoming aware of this matter, we contacted the FBI and initiated a comprehensive investigation working with a leading third party forensic investigation firm,” said Aurobindo Sundaram, vice president of information assurance and data protection at Reed Elsevier, the parent company of LexisNexis.  “In that investigation, we have identified an intrusion targeting our data but to date have found no evidence that customer or consumer data were reached or retrieved.  Because this matter is actively being investigated by law enforcement, I can’t provide further information at this time.”

Dun & Bradstreet and Altegrity were less forthcoming about what they’d found so far. Elliot Glazer, chief technology officer at Dun & Bradstreet, said the information provided about the botnet’s interaction with the company’s internal systems had been “very helpful.”

“We are aggressively investigating the matter, take it very seriously and are in touch with the appropriate authorities,” Glazer said. “Data security is a company priority, and I can assure you that we are devoting all resources necessary to ensure that security.”

Altegrity declined to confirm or deny the apparent compromises, but through spokesman Ray Howell offered the following statement: “We consider the protection and safeguarding of our various systems of the utmost importance. We have dedicated significant information security resources to managing security and protecting the data and privacy of our customers. We have a range of incident response specialists and  teams from both inside and outside the company investigating your allegations vigorously.”

Referring to the SSNDOB compromises, FBI Spokesperson Lindsay Godwin confirmed that the FBI is “aware of and investigating this case,” but declined to comment further except to say that the investigation is ongoing.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER

The intrusions raise major questions about how these compromises may have aided identity thieves. The prevailing wisdom suggests that the attackers were going after these firms for the massive amounts of consumer and business data that they hold. While those data stores are certainly substantial, fraud experts say the really valuable stuff is in the data that these firms hold about consumer and business habits and practices.

The botnet control panel entry for a hacked Dun & Bradstreet server

Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst with Gartner Inc., said most credit-granting organizations assess the likelihood that a given application for credit is valid or fraudulent largely based on how accurately an applicant answers a set of questions about their financial and consumer history.

These questions, known in industry parlance as “knowledge-based authentication” or KBA for short, have become the gold standard of authentication among nearly all credit-granting institutions, from loan providers to credit card companies, Litan said. She estimates that the KBA market is worth at least $2 billion a year.

“Let’s say you’re trying to move money via online bank transfer, or apply for a new line of credit,” Litan proposed. “There are about 100 questions and answers that companies like LexisNexis store on all of us, such as, ‘What was your previous address?’ or ‘Which company services your mortgage?’ They also have a bunch of bogus questions that they can serve up to see if you really are who you say you are.”

According to Litan, Dun and Bradstreet does roughly the same thing, except for businesses.

“Dun & Bradstreet doesn’t do KBA per se, but if you’re filling out a business loan and you want to pose as that business, having access to a company like that can help,” Litan said. “Dun & Bradstreet is like the credit bureau for businesses.”

Overall, Litan says, credit applicants fail to answer one or more of the KBA questions correctly about 10-15 percent of the time. Ironically, however, those that get the questions wrong are more often legitimate credit applicants — not the identity thieves.

“These days, the people who fail these questions are mainly those who don’t remember the answers,” Litan said. “But the criminals seem to be having no problems.”

Litan related a story she heard from one fellow fraud analyst who had an opportunity to listen in on the KBA questions that a mortgage lender was asking of a credit applicant who was later determined to have been a fraudster.

“The woman on the phone was asking the applicant, ‘Hey, what is the amount of your last mortgage payment?’, and you could hear the guy on the other line saying hold on a minute….and you could hear him clicking through page after page for the right questions,” Litan said.

The Gartner fraud analyst said she has long suspected that the major KBA providers have been compromised, and has been saying so for years.

“We could well be witnessing the death of knowledge-based authentication, and it’s as it should be,” Litan said. “The problem is that right now there are no good alternatives that are as easy to implement. There isn’t a good software-based alternative. Everybody in the industry knows that KBA is nearing its end of usefulness, but it’s not like you can instantly roll out biometric identifiers to the entire US population. We’re just not there yet. It’s years away. If ever.”

CUSTOMER SERVICE

Breakdown of ssn[dot]dob users by IP address

A closer examination of the database for the identity theft service shows it has served more than 1.02 million unique SSNs to customers and nearly 3.1 million date of birth records since its inception in early 2012.
Thousands of background reports also have been ordered through SSNDOB. Records at the ID theft service indicate that the service was still able to order background reports via LexisNexis more than 10 days after the data aggregator disabled the infected Web servers listed in the botnet’s control panel, suggesting that the intruders still had a store of accounts that could be used to pull information from the company’s databanks.

In a written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, LexisNexis officials said that report was generated from a law student ID that was being misused.

“Unrelated to the intrusion you have asked about, you provided to us a LexisNexis report.  We determined that that report was generated from a law student ID that was being misused.  That ID accesses only unregulated public records information and was identified by our fraud detection tools and shut down by us before you brought it to our attention.”

The registration records for SSNDOB show that most users registered with the ID theft service using Internet addresses in the United States, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom, although it is likely that a large portion of these users were using hacked PCs or other proxy systems to mask their true location.

SSNDOB also appears to have licensed its system for use by at least a dozen high-volume users. There is some evidence which indicates that these users are operating third-party identity theft services. A review of the leaked site records show that several bulk buyers were given application programming interfaces (APIs) — customized communications channels that allow disparate systems to exchange data — that could permit third-party or competing online ID theft sites to conduct lookups directly and transparently through the SSNDOB Web site.

Indeed, the records from SSNDOB show that the re-sellers of its service reliably brought in more money than manual look-ups conducted by all of the site’s 1,300 individual customers combined.

Target confirmed Thursday that previous reports about the unauthorized access of customers’ credit card data were true.

In a press release posted on the Target website, the Minneapolis-based retailer admitted that approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts may have been impacted by the breach. 

Affected customers made purchases in U.S. stores from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15, 2013.

Target is currently working with law enforcement and financial institutions to resolve the issue.

“Target’s first priority is preserving the trust of our guests and we have moved swiftly to address this issue, so guests can shop with confidence. We regret any inconvenience this may cause,” Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Target stated in a press release. “We take this matter very seriously and are working with law enforcement to bring those responsible to justice.”

Here’s more from the Associated Press:

Target Corp. advised customers who suspect there has been unauthorized activity on their cards should call them at 866-852-8680.

Target is just the latest retailer to be hit with a data breach problem. TJX Cos., which runs stores such as T.J. Maxx and Marshall’s, had a breach that began in July 2005 that exposed at least 45.7 million credit and debit cards to possible fraud. The breach wasn’t detected until December 2006. In June 2009 TJX agreed to pay $9.75 million in a settlement with multiple states related to the massive data theft but stressed at the time that it firmly believed it did not violate any consumer protection or data security laws.

In a statement posted on its website Wednesday night, Neiman Marcus said that the malware had been “clandestinely” put into its system and had stolen payment data off cards used from July 16 to Oct. 30. MasterCard, Visa and Discover have told the company that about 2,400 cards used at Neiman Marcus and its Last Call outlet stores have since been used fraudulently.

The Neiman Marcus Group, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman, has said it was not aware of the data theft until mid-December, when a payment processor reported that unauthorized charges were showing up on cards used at its stores. It now plans to notify all customers who shopped in those stores from January 2013 to this month — and for whom the company has a mailing or email address. Like Target, it said it would offer those shoppers one free year of credit monitoring.

In the instances of widespread data theft at Target and Neiman Marcus, the malware was designed to hook into cash registers to monitor the credit card authorization process. Before a transaction can be authorized, credit card data is momentarily decrypted and stored in memory. Called RAM-scraping malware, it is built to scrape that unencrypted data from memory and steal it, according to a private report issued by iSight Partners, which is working with the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the retail attacks.

The data thefts have reignited a push for more secure credit and debit cards, similar to those used in Europe and elsewhere, and have prompted some congressional committees and senators to renew calls for tougher consumer protections.

In addition to an investigation of the breach by the Secret Service, the Justice Department and several state attorneys general, the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked Target for documents related to its cybersecurity efforts and the malware used in the attack. Target’s chief financial officer, John J. Mulligan, will be the first witness to appear before the committee at a hearing on Feb. 4. Federal authorities also are expected to testify.

Since the Target breach in November, the attention of retailers and the card industry has turned to EMV technology, named for its founders, Eurocard, MasterCard and Visa. Cards using the technology have a small chip embedded that creates a new code for each transaction, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit the cards in the way that has happened since card numbers were stolen from Target.  
“EMV wouldn’t have stopped it, but it would have helped minimize the impact after the event,” according to Don Tait, an analyst at IHS.  
The United States is one of the last countries to move toward the technology. In Europe, 81 percent of the cards have EMV chips, according to the consulting firm Celent. Countries that have adopted the technology have seen a sharp decline in credit card fraud. In Britain the amount of fraud per transaction has dropped 57 percent since 2002. Meanwhile, fraud has risen sharply in the United States, some 70 percent between 2004 and 2010, Celent information shows.

While the United States accounts for only 27 percent of the credit card transactions in the world, it is responsible for 47 percent of card fraud, according to data from the Nilson Report, a newsletter about the payment industry.

“The rest of the world is onto new technology, and we’re still using magnetic stripe technology that was used for eight track tape players in the 1960s,” Chris McWilton, a MasterCard executive, said on Thursday. “No wonder the fraudsters have found us.”

The United States has not moved faster because retailers and card issuers have worried that the cost of adopting the technology, usually estimated at $15 billion to $30 billion, would be more than the cost of the fraud it prevented. Even with increasing fraud in the United States, it has only cost about 5 cents for every $100 of credit card use.  
The main proponents of change have been the major card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have all said that American retailers need to install hardware that can read EMV cards by October 2015. Any retailers that do not, and have data stolen, will be liable for the costs of any fraud.

In the last year, retailers complained frequently about the costs of shifting to another technology. In October, a Visa executive hinted that the company was listening to the retailers and considering revising its schedule. Regulatory changes, meanwhile, have muddied the waters of how chip technology could be applied uniformly.

“There was a clear apathy in the industry,” said Zilvinas Bareisis, a card analyst at Celent, said of the retailers’ reluctance.

But now, many players, including the Target chief executive Gregg W. Steinhafel, have talked about the importance of moving to EMV. In a letter this month, MasterCard told its clients it was recommitting itself to making the transition happen by 2015.  
“It’s been a wake-up call,” Mr. McWilton said in an interview. “There were a lot of naysayers and people satisfied with the status quo. Now, I think, people have woke up and said, ‘If you don’t have the public trust, you don’t have the business.’ ”  
Investors are betting that the revived interest in new technology will lead to changes. The stock of companies that would manufacture some of the new technology has been pushed up since the Target breach. Verifone, the most prominent manufacturer of payment hardware, is up 27 percent over the last month.

But card issuers have been careful to point out that cards with chips will not stamp out all fraud. The chips do not prevent card numbers for being used fraudulently online, and in Britain that sort of crime has risen even while overall fraud has dropped. On that front, many financial firms have been pushing the idea of tokenization, which creates a new code for each transaction, making it hard to use the same card repeatedly. Mr. Bareisis said it could be a problem if the United States adopted only one part of the antifraud technology available.

Recently, smaller instances of customer data theft have surfaced at other retailers, as well.

Nordstrom said it found skimming devices on 10 registers at a store in Miami in October, which stripped information like account numbers and expiration dates off cards. (A company spokeswoman said that the attack appeared to have been confined to just those machines and that the company had no evidence its system was breached.) And this week, Easton-Bell Sports said 6,000 people who shopped at its online store in December had their information compromised, including names, email addresses, credit card numbers or card security codes.

Criminal demand for the kind of point-of-sale malware used in the attacks on Target and Neiman Marcus has been steadily growing. Security specialists say cybercriminals will post advertisements on online freelancing sites looking for help in developing point-of-sale malware. Last July, on a popular freelancing site, security researchers at iSight Partners found that more than 20 percent of all ads appeared to be from criminals looking to hire hackers with expertise in point-of-sale systems.

And hackers that have expertise in point-of-sale systems have been increasing their rates. Early in 2010, hackers were charging $425 to $2,500 for point-of-sale malware projects. By the end of the year, their rates had spiked to $6,500, according to a report prepared by iSight Partners

Though most point-of-sale malware developers are based in Eastern Europe, security researchers say that cybercriminals in Brazil have been developing and using point-of-sale malware since at least 2009.

AOL has released more details about a major hack of AOL Mail this month, in which users' accounts were compromised to send out spam messages.

The company is still investigating the breach, but AOL confirmed in a company blog post Monday that ""there was unauthorized access to information regarding a significant number of user accounts.""

Thankfully, no financial details appear to be affected. But hackers did access a trove of personal data including AOL users' email addresses, mailing addresses, contacts, encrypted passwords, encrypted answers to security questions used for resetting passwords, and some employee information.

Spammers used that information to send ""spoofed"" emails -- messages that appear to be from a valid address or trusted contact, but are not actually from those contacts -- from about 2 percent all AOL Mail accounts, the company said.

AOL is notifying users who may have been affected, the company said Monday, and it is working with law enforcement ""to investigate this serious criminal activity.""

Customer complaints about the spoofing began popping up early last week, including on Twitter with the hashtag #aolhacked.

AOL posted a warning on April 22 about the attack, and stated that it would change its policy ""to help mail providers reject email messages that are sent using forged AOL Mail addresses.""

"154","Community Health Systems","4,500,000","2014","Hospital network hacked, 4.5 million records stolen
Community Health Systems, which operates 206 hospitals across the United States, announced on Monday that hackers recently broke into its computers and stole data on 4.5 million patients.
Hackers have gained access to their names, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, birthdays and telephone numbers.

Anyone who received treatment from a physician's office tied to a network-owned hospital in the last five years -- or was merely referred there by an outside doctor -- is affected.

The large data breach puts these people at heightened risk of identity fraud. That allows criminals open bank accounts and credit cards on their behalf, take out loans and ruin personal credit history.

The company's hospitals operate in 28 states but have their most significant presence in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.

Community Health Systems (CYH) hired cybersecurity experts at Mandiant to consult on the hack. They have determined the hackers were in China and used high-end, sophisticated malware to launch the attacks sometime in April and June this year.

The FBI said it's working closely with the hospital network and ""committing significant resources and efforts to target, disrupt, dismantle and arrest the perpetrators.""

Federal investigators and Mandiant told the hospital network those hackers have previously been spotted conducting corporate espionage, targeting valuable information about medical devices.

But this time, the hackers stole patient data instead. Hackers did not manage to steal information related to patients' medical histories, clinical operations or credit cards.

Still, the lost personal information is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the federal health records protection law. That means state attorneys general could sue for damages. Under state laws, patients themselves could sue the hospital network for negligence.

As for exposed victims protecting themselves? There's little they can do.

Shares of the publicly-traded Community Health Systems edged higher Monday morning. But the company tried to stem worries about the damages in a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying that it ""carries cyber/privacy liability insurance to protect it against certain losses related to matters of this nature.""

The hospital network said that just before Monday's announcement, it managed to wipe the hackers' malware from its computer systems and implemented protections to prevent similar break-ins.

The company plans to offer identity theft protection to the 4.5 million victims of the data breach.

"155","Privatization Agency of the Republic of Serbia","5,190,396","2014","VIOLATION OF RIGHTS TO PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION OF ALMOST ALL ADULT SERBIAN CITIZENS

The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection is conducting a supervision procedure over the implementation of the Law on Personal Data Protection (LPDP) by the Privatization Agency.

The supervision procedure was launched several days ago and it would last for some time; however it is now evident that the results of the procedure will be the most drastic confirmation of the incomprehensible, irresponsible attitude of the state towards the right to personal data protection.

A vast amount of personal data (name, surname, Personal ID Number and some other data) of almost all adult citizens of the Republic of Serbia is exposed to the risk of unauthorized processing and abuse.

Following the surveillance procedure, the Commissioner shall, as usual, inform the public about all relevant facts, institute misdemeanor proceedings against the responsible persons and require the prosecutors' offices and MoI to institute (ex officio) proceedings so as to establish criminal liability.

In this regard the Commissioner, Rodoljub Sabic, has stated the following:

""The surveillance procedure has been launched ex officio on the basis of alleged evidence obtained from social media sites and the citizens' complaints which indicated the possibility of unauthorized access to personal data held by the Privatization Agency.

The allegations have been confirmed upon investigation. Even though, for example, the data file ''Right holders' register'' has been reported by the Agency and entered in the Register maintained by the Commissioner as the ""data file maintained on a dedicated computer, which is safeguarded by the system of authorization and authentication passwords and accessed only by authorized persons"", prior to the Commissioner's intervention, anyone could have simply accessed the said data file.

Due to the volume of available information (1.22 GB) it was not possible to immediately ascertain the exact number of affected citizens, but owing to the good collaboration with the civil sector experts, and especially the ""Share Foundation"" it was ascertained that there were about 5,190,000 affected citizens.

This case should not be linked to the news of ""hacker threats"" which have been a prominent feature in the media for several days now. In the case of the ""Serbian hackers"", according to what we could observe, this was a much smaller number of personal data most probably from a data base of ''committed voters"" of a political party. In the case of the Privatization Agency we are dealing with a far greater number of data whose compromising can be laid at the door of a public authority. It is particularly worrying that in order to access and download the data held by the Agency neither hacker operations nor special knowledge were required, one could have done it relatively easy by using active links on the webpage of the Agency and a web search engine.

Following several warnings, which I have referred to the competent authorities, I wish to believe that at least this scandalous case would lead to a serious change of the state's attitude towards the right to personal data protection. This, among other things, necessarily implies accountability as well. I' am here referring to not only to the accountability the people in charge of the software, technical and physical data security, but particularly to the political and occupational accountability of the public officials and ""experts"" with the competent authorities, who are responsible for the development of the normative system, education and strategic approach and who have made incomprehensible omissions in this regard and ignored evident problems for a long time.""

"156","Sony Pictures","10,000,000","2014","A Look Through The Sony Pictures Data Hack: This Is As Bad As It Gets
After sifting through almost 40GB of leaked internal data, one thing is clear: Sony Pictures appears to have suffered the most embarrassing and all-encompassing hack of internal corporate data ever made public.

The data dump, which was reviewed extensively by BuzzFeed News, includes employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence. There are spreadsheets containing the salaries of 6,800 global employees, along with Social Security numbers for 3,500 U.S. staff. And there is extensive documentation of the company's operations, ranging from the script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan to the results of sales meetings with local TV executives.

The documents made public this weekend, covering the company's human resources, sales, and marketing teams, among others, are just a fraction of approximately 100TB of data the hackers claim to have taken from Sony. They say it will all be made freely available online, once they figure out how to distribute such an enormous amount of information.

A Sony Pictures spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the data released, but shared a brief statement saying the company ""continues to work through issues related to what was clearly a cyber attack last week."" Sony is ""working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter,"" it said.

The hackers, who call themselves the Guardians of Peace, took credit for the attack this weekend, emailing members of the media with links to download dozens of compressed files, each containing vast troves of data stolen from the servers of Sony Pictures. Earlier, the hackers leaked high-quality video files of five unreleased Sony films. The box office impact of that release, analysts told BuzzFeed News, probably won't be that bad. But the broader cost to Sony of this new round of leaks — to its reputation, its employee morale, and its commercial standing — seems impossible to estimate.

In a memo to employees, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Sony Pictures Entertainment chiefs Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal pulled no punches.

""While we are not yet sure of the full scope of information that the attackers have or might release, we unfortunately have to ask you to assume that information about you in the possession of the company might be in their possession,"" the memo said. ""While we would hope that common decency might prevent disclosure, we of course cannot assume that.""

The leak is particularly embarrassing because it comes just three and a half years after Sony and its gaming customers suffered through a three-week-long hacking nightmare that brought the company's Playstation gaming networks offline and compromised the personal and financial information of up to 25 million customers (though the company did not confirm how many accounts had financial information stolen).

In the days after the April 2011 breach, Sony enlisted three independent computer security and forensic consulting firms to assess its security infrastructure and identify the culprit of the hack, according to a letter from Sony to members of Congress. In the letter, Sony defended its decision to wait five days to admit its security had been compromised and called on the government to help make the internet safer. ""We ask the Committee to consider as well the connection between data security and the cybercrimes and cyber terrorism that threaten to make the Internet unsafe for consumers and commerce,"" the letter read.

Years after that hack, Sony Pictures still seems to have a long way to go. One of the files leaked this weekend was a Word document titled ""Passwords"" that contained an executive's computer, LotusNotes, and American Express usernames and passwords, as well as Amex credit card numbers, expiration dates, and four-digit security codes.

The roughly 40GB of company information now available online sat on company servers without encryption, with a vast majority of the sensitive personal and financial files containing no password protection. Currently, the stolen data trove is available to download, potentially placing the information in the hands of any hacker, scammer, criminal, media organization, or curious citizen who knows their way around a torrent file.

The release of such sensitive data could easily eclipse the leaking of five unreleased films, in terms of its impact on the company's bottom line. ""Financially it will cost more to clean up this mess than what they would lose at the box office,"" said a movie industry source who requested anonymity because of ties to Sony. ""Firewalls, consultants, all that stuff is expensive.""

Sony Pictures employees now face the grim prospect of extremely personal information bouncing around the internet forever. The documents lifted from company servers include email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate. None of the names on any of the files is redacted.

In some cases, extensive stores of personal employee files — documents that have nothing to do with Sony corporate business — were included in the breach. One document swept up in the hack outlines the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive.

Leaked performance evaluations cover, sometimes in great detail, how individual employees failed to live up to the expectations of their managers. There are also detailed compensation reports for Sony's executives, including their last three years of compensation at Sony, their target bonus, actual bonus, and base salary. It also compares them to similarly situated employees in other companies and reviews their proposed contracts for the next three years.

Alongside that: salary information on almost 7,000 employees, from those on multimillion-dollar contracts to those earning less than $21,000.

Some believe the leak might have been the work of hackers backed by the North Korean government, which has expressed outrage at an upcoming Sony Pictures comedy film, The Interview, which is built around an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korean officials have previously described the unreleased film as an act of war, and in a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the country's United Nations ambassador said the film was a form of terrorism.

When asked by the BBC on Tuesday if their country was responsible for the Sony Pictures hack, a North Korean government spokesperson replied, ""Wait and see.""

And this may be just the beginning. ""We have much more interesting data,"" the hackers said in an email sent to media, including BuzzFeed News. ""If you find special interest, send an email.""

"157","Indiana University","146,000","2014","Indiana University reports potential data exposure

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Indiana University notified the Indiana attorney general’s office today of the potential exposure of personal data for some students and recent graduates. 

The data potentially at risk for disclosure includes names, addresses and Social Security numbers for approximately 146,000 students and recent graduates across seven IU campuses who attended the university from 2011 to 2014.

Unlike recent high-profile data breaches, however, no servers or systems were compromised. The information was not downloaded by an unauthorized individual looking for specific sensitive data, but rather was accessed by three automated computer data mining applications, called webcrawlers, used to improve Web search capabilities.

Immediately upon discovering the potential issue, IU secured the data, and the university has no evidence that the files have been viewed or used for inappropriate or illegal purposes. As a precaution, however, the university will begin notifying all affected students of the possible data exposure this week.

“IU takes the security of all its data, especially the personal information of its students, extremely seriously and apologizes for any concern this issue may cause among our students and their families,” said John Applegate, executive vice president for university academic affairs. “The university also is committed to assisting those whose information was potentially exposed.”

In addition to notifying those affected by the potential exposure, IU is taking the following steps to minimize the potential impact of this incident: 

The university will set up a call center to handle questions from anyone whose information was potentially placed at risk as a result of this situation. That center will be operational no later than 8 a.m. EST on Friday, Feb. 28, at 866-254-1484.
A website with information on how to monitor one’s credit accounts and with answers to other questions regarding the potential data exposure has been established at https://apps.usss.iu.edu/usss-data-exposure/faq.cfm. 
To assist with credit monitoring, IU will supply the Social Security numbers and names of those potentially affected to all three major credit-reporting agencies.
The university discovered late last week that the data had been stored in an insecure location for the past 11 months. The issue was discovered by a staff member of the university registrar’s office who accessed the files in question for internal use. The site was immediately locked down, and the information was moved to a secure location the following day. 

It was determined that a change in the security protections for the site that housed the information, made in March 2013, inadvertently allowed the site to be accessed without the necessary authentication. A subsequent review of access logs late last week determined that the data in question had been downloaded only by the three automated webcrawling programs. The files in question were safeguarded to mask the nature of the data contained in them.

“This is not a case of a targeted attempt to obtain data for illegal purposes, and we believe the chance of sensitive data falling into the wrong hands as a result of this situation is remote,” said James Kennedy, associate vice president for financial aid and university student services and systems. “At the same time, we have moved quickly to secure the data and are conducting a thorough investigation into our information handling process to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.”

BOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc initially believed that its customers' data was safe as forensic investigators reviewed a network security breach discovered in early May and made public this week, a senior executive told Reuters on Friday.
EBay has come under fire over its handling of the cyberattack, in which hackers accessed personal data of all 145 million users, ranking it among the biggest such attacks launched on a corporation to date.

""For a very long period of time we did not believe that there was any eBay customer data compromised,"" global marketplaces chief Devin Wenig said, in the first comments by a top eBay executive since the e-commerce company disclosed the breach on Wednesday.

EBay moved ""swiftly to disclose"" the breach after it realized customer data was involved, he said.

Wenig would not say when the company first realized that the cyberattackers accessed customer data, nor how long it took to prepare Wednesday's announcement.

He said hackers got in using the credentials of three corporate employees, eventually making their way to the user database.

Hackers accessed email addresses and encrypted passwords belonging to all eBay users. ""Millions"" of users have since reset their passwords and the company had begun notifying users, though it would take some time to complete that task, Wenig said.

""You would imagine that anyone who has ever touched eBay is a large number,"" he said. ""So we're going to send all of them an email, but sending that number all at once is not operationally possible.""

At least three U.S. states are investigating the company's security practices. Customers have complained on social media about delayed notification emails. And New York's attorney general called on eBay to provide free credit monitoring services to users.

But the Internet retail giant has no plans to compensate customers or offer free credit monitoring for now because it had detected no financial fraud, Wenig said.

Wenig declined comment when asked if he thought eBay had good security prior to the breach. He said the company would now bolster its security systems, and has mobilized senior executives in a subsequent investigation of the attack.

""We want to make sure it doesn’t happen again so we’re going to continue to look our procedures, harden our operational environment and add levels of security where it’s appropriate.""

The breach marked the latest headache for eBay this year. In January, it crossed swords publicly with activist investor Carl Icahn, who mounted a campaign to get it to spin out PayPal. Then in April, the e-commerce company disappointed investors with a weak second-quarter outlook, pressuring its shares.

AVOIDING BACK DOORS
Buying and selling activity on eBay remained ""fairly normal"" though eBay is still working out the cost of the breach, which included hiring a number of security firms. Wenig, who was previously a senior executive at Thomson Reuters Corp, declined to comment on whether the cost could be material to eBay's results.

Wenig's revelation that the company initially believed that no customer data had been compromised might take some of the heat off eBay's executive team.

Cyber forensics experts said it's not uncommon for large companies to take weeks to grasp the full impact of an attack, because hackers are often able to steal data without leaving obvious clues.

""In some cases you go in and find the smoking gun immediately. Other times, it takes a few days or even a few weeks,"" said Kevin Johnson, a cyber-forensics expert who was not involved in the eBay investigation but has worked for other Fortune 500 companies.

Daniel Clemens, a forensics expert and CEO of Packet Ninjas, said investigators often ask companies to hold off on disclosure until they believe they understand the full extent of an attack. Otherwise, they risk tipping off attackers who might cover their tracks or leave ""back doors"" so they can return after the investigators complete their probe.

On Wednesday, the e-commerce company announced that hackers raided its network between late February and early March. The company said financial information was not compromised and its payments unit PayPal was not affected.

When eBay first discovered the network breach in early May, the senior team was immediately involved and held multiple daily calls on the issue. EBay staff have been working around the clock since Wednesday.

Wenig said he could not provide much more detail about what happened in the attack beyond the scant information given out so far. He declined to provide further specifics, citing ongoing investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and several forensics firms including FireEye Inc's Mandiant division.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has had its website hacked, with sensitive personal information including email addresses and contact data stolen.

The ECB received an anonymous call on Monday night requesting money in return for the stolen data. The bank didn't say how much the blackmailer asked for, but did say that it refused to pay anything. 

According to the bank's website, the theft was from a database ""separate from any internal system"" and no market-sensitive data was stolen.


The database serves parts of the ECB website that gather registrations for events such as ECB conferences and visits. It is physically separate from any internal ECB systems.

A statement on the website said:

The theft came to light after an anonymous email was sent to the ECB seeking financial compensation for the data. While most of the data were encrypted, parts of the database included email addresses, some street addresses and phone numbers that were not encrypted. The database also contains data on downloads from the ECB website in encrypted form.

The ECB is contacting people whose email addresses or other data might have been compromised and all passwords have been changed on the system as a precaution.

The ECB takes data security extremely seriously. German police have been informed of the theft and an investigation has started.

ECB data security experts have addressed the vulnerability.

"161","JP Morgan Chase","76,000,000","2014","JPMorgan Chase Hacking Affects 76 Million Households

A cyberattack this summer on JPMorgan Chase compromised the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, a tally that dwarfs previous estimates by the bank and puts the intrusion among the largest ever.

The details of the breach — disclosed in a securities filing on Thursday — emerge at a time when consumer confidence in the digital operations of corporate America has already been shaken. Target, Home Depot and a number of other retailers have sustained major data breaches. Last year, the information of 40 million cardholders and 70 million others were compromised at Target, while an attack at Home Depot in September affected 56 million cards.

But unlike retailers, JPMorgan, as the largest bank in the nation, has financial information in its computer systems that goes beyond customers’ credit card details and potentially includes more sensitive data.

“We’ve migrated so much of our economy to computer networks because they are faster and more efficient, but there are side effects,” said Dan Kaminsky, a researcher who works as chief scientist at White Ops, a security company.

Until just a few weeks ago, executives at JPMorgan said they believed that only one million accounts were affected, according to several people with knowledge of the attacks.

As the severity of the intrusion — which began in June but was not discovered until July — became more clear in recent days, bank executives scrambled for the second time in three months to contain the fallout and to reassure skittish customers that no money had been taken and that their financial information remained secure.

The hackers appeared to have obtained a list of the applications and programs that run on JPMorgan’s computers — a road map of sorts — which they could crosscheck with known vulnerabilities in each program and web application, in search of an entry point back into the bank’s systems, according to several people with knowledge of the results of the bank’s forensics investigation, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Operating overseas, the hackers gained access to the names, addresses, phone numbers and emails of JPMorgan account holders. In its regulatory filing on Thursday, JPMorgan said that there was no evidence that account information, including passwords or Social Security numbers, had been taken. The bank also noted that there was no evidence of fraud involving the use of customer information.

Still, until the JPMorgan breach surfaced in July, banks were viewed as relatively safe from online assaults because of their investment in defenses and trained security staff. Most previous breaches at banks have involved stealing personal identification numbers for A.T.M. accounts, not burrowing deep into the internal workings of a bank’s computer systems.

Even if no customer financial information was taken, the apparent breadth and depth of the JPMorgan attack shows how vulnerable Wall Street institutions are to cybercrime. In 2011, hackers broke into the systems of the Nasdaq stock market, but did not penetrate the part of the system that handles trades.

Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, has acknowledged the growing digital threat. In his annual letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said, “We’re making good progress on these and other efforts, but cyberattacks are growing every day in strength and velocity across the globe.”

Even though the bank has fortified its defenses against the attacks, Mr. Dimon wrote, the battle is “continual and likely never-ending.”

On Thursday, some lawmakers weighed in. Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said “the data breach at JPMorgan Chase is yet another example of how Americans’ most sensitive personal information is in danger.”

Hackers drilled deep into the bank’s vast computer systems, reaching more than 90 servers, the people with knowledge of the investigation said. As they analyze the contours of the breach, investigators in law enforcement remain puzzled, partly because there is no evidence that the attackers looted any money from customer accounts.

That lack of any apparent profit motive has generated speculation among the law enforcement officials and security experts that the hackers, which some thought to be from Russia and may have been sponsored by elements of the Russian government, the people with knowledge of the investigation said.

By the time the bank’s security team discovered the breach in late July, hackers had already obtained the highest level of administrative privilege to dozens of the bank’s computer servers, according to the people with knowledge of the investigation. It is still unclear how hackers managed to gain such deep access.

The people with knowledge of the investigation said it would take months for the bank to swap out its programs and applications and renegotiate licensing deals with its technology suppliers, possibly giving the hackers time to mine the bank’s systems for unpatched, or undiscovered, vulnerabilities that would allow them re-entry into JPMorgan’s systems.

Beyond its disclosures, JPMorgan did not comment on what its investigation had found. Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said that describing the bank’s breach as among the largest was “comparing apples and oranges.”

Preparing for the disclosure on Thursday, JPMorgan retained the law firm WilmerHale to help with its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, people with knowledge of the matter said. Earlier on Thursday, some executives — Barry Sommers, the chief executive of Chase’s consumer bank — flew back to New York from Naples, Fla., where they had convened for a leadership conference, these people said.

The initial discovery of the hack sent chills down Wall Street and prompted an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The bank was also forced to update its regulators, including the Federal Reserve, on the extent of the breach.

Faced with the rising threat of online crime, JPMorgan has said it plans to spend $250 million on digital security annually, but had been losing many of its security staff to other banks over the last year, with others expected to leave soon.","financial","3",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"162","New York Taxis","52,000","2014","On Taxis and Rainbows
Recently, thanks to a Freedom of Information request, Chris Whong received and made public a complete dump of historical trip and fare logs from NYC taxis. It’s pretty incredible: there are over 20GB of uncompressed data comprising more than 173 million individual trips. Each trip record includes the pickup and dropoff location and time, anonymized hack licence number and medallion number (i.e. the taxi’s unique id number, 3F38, in my photo above), and other metadata.
These data are a veritable trove for people who love cities, transit, and data visualization. But there’s a big problem: the personally identifiable information (the driver’s licence number and taxi number) hasn’t been anonymized properly — what’s worse, it’s trivial to undo, and with other publicly available data, one can even figure out which person drove each trip. In the rest of this post, I’ll describe the structure of the data, what the person/people who released the data did wrong, how easy it is to deanonymize, and the lessons other agencies should learn from this. (And yes, I’ll also explain how rainbows fit in).
The NYC taxi data consist of a number of CSV-files, each with lines that look like this:
6B111958A39B24140C973B262EA9FEA5,D3B035A03C8A34DA17488129DA581EE7,VTS,5,,2013-12-03 15:46:00,2013-12-03 16:47:00,1,3660,22.71,-73.813927,40.698135,-74.093307,40.829346
Each of these columns correspond to the following fields:
medallion,hack_license,vendor_id,rate_code,store_and_fwd_flag,pickup_datetime,dropoff_datetime,passenger_count,trip_time_in_secs 
It’s pretty obvious what format most of the fields are in (lon/lat, timestamp) but the first two columns demonstrate that the government folks clearly intended to anonymize the medallion and licence numbers. It’s obvious that the alphanumeric codes are not purely random, the same taxi and same driver always has the same code throughout the data. This isn’t necessarily a problem — in fact, preserving this property is often of critical importance when anonymizing data. Imagine a search engine engineer who wants to analyse user behaviour in aggregate: it’s important that the same user has the same code throughout the set of logs that are being analysed, so that you can see what a user does over time. It’s obviously also critical that it’s not possible to go backwards from the code to the user’s name.
Someone on Reddit pointed out that one specific driver seemed to be doing an incredible amount of business. When faced with anomalous data like that, it’s good practice to weed out data error before jumping to conclusions about cheating taxi drivers. Also, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something about that encoded id number: “CFCD208495D565EF66E7DFF9F98764DA.” After a little bit of poking around, I realised that that code is actually the MD5 hash of the character ‘0’. This proved my suspicion that this was actually a data collection error, but also made me immediately realise that the entire anonymization process was flawed and could easily be reversed.
A cryptographically secure hashing function, like MD5 is a one-way function: it always turns the same input to the same output, but given the output, it’s pretty hard to figure out what the input was as long as you don’t know anything about what the input might look like. This is mostly what you’d like out of an anonymization function. The problem, however, is that in this case we know a lot about what the inputs look like.
In NYC, taxi licence numbers are 6-digit [Edit: (6-digit numbers may start with any digit and are sometimes zero-padded)], or 7-digit numbers starting with a 5. That means that there are only about 3M possible taxi licence numbers. Similarly, medallion numbers conform to a very specific pattern:
one number, one letter, two numbers. For example: 5X55
two letters, three numbers. For example: XX555
three letters, three numbers. For example: XXX555
[Edit: I fixed my math thanks (thanks Paul)] There are about 1000*27²*26 = 18954000 or ~19M possible medallion numbers. So, by calculating the md5 hashes of all these numbers (only 22M!), one can completely deanonymise the entire data. Modern computers are fast: so fast that computing the 22M hashes took less than 2 minutes. The resulting table of hashed-data to input data is called a Rainbow Table. [Edit: people have pointed out that this may not meet the exact requirements to be called a rainbow table]
It took a while longer to de-anonymize the entire dataset, but thanks to Yelp’s MRJob, I ran a map-reduce over about 10 computers on EMR and had it done within an hour. There’s a ton of resources on NYC Taxi and Limousine commission, including a mapping from licence number to driver name, and a way to look up owners of medallions. I haven’t linked them here but it’s easy to find using a quick Google search.
Here are a few de-anonymized lines I picked at random:
9Y99,5296319,VTS,1,,2013-12-06 00:07:00,2013-12-06 00:16:00,5,540,1.85,-73.97953,40.776447,-73.982254,40.754925 
9Y99,5296319,VTS,1,,2013-12-06 00:20:00,2013-12-06 00:46:00,5,1560,6.58,-73.985779,40.757317,-73.984543,40.681244 
DIP1,111333,VTS,1,,2013-12-03 12:10:00,2013-12-03 12:24:00,5,840,.00,0,0,0,0 
SBV106,429925,VTS,1,,2013-12-05 23:04:00,2013-12-05 23:16:00,6,720,2.86,-73.988197,40.731232,-73.96199,40.764343 
Security researchers have been warning for a while that simply using hash functions is an ineffective way to anonymize data. In this case, it’s substantially worse because of the structured format of the input data. This anonymization is so poor that anyone could, with less then 2 hours work, figure which driver drove every single trip in this entire dataset. It would be even be easy to calculate drivers’ gross income, or infer where they live.
There are a number of ways these data could have been better anonymized. Two good ones include:
assigning a totally random number to each hack licence number and medallion number once, and re-using it throughout the dump file
creating a secret AES key, and encrypting each value individually
[Edit: As always, things are more complicated than they seem at first. The strategies described above will anonymise the numbers of the licences and taxicabs, but commenters have pointed out that there are a number of other ways in whch PII may be reconstructed. The most interesting is Narayanan and Shmatikov’s algorithm. NYC is dense enough that it may be much more challenging to target specific passengers using these data, however. Anonymizing data is really hard.]
The cat is already out of the bag in this case, but hopefully in the future, agencies will think carefully about the method they use to anonymize data before releasing it to the public.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - HSBC Turkey said on Wednesday cyber criminals had stolen the credit card information of 2.7 million customers in Turkey and that additional security measures to monitor transactions had been put in place.

In a message to customers on its website, the bank said an attack on its credit card and debit card systems in Turkey had been thwarted but card numbers, account numbers, card expiry dates and customer names had been “compromised”.

“There is no financial risk to our customers and there has been no evidence of any fraud or other suspicious activity arising from this incident,” the statement said.

HSBC has about 3 million customers in Turkey and 330 branches, according to its website.

"164","Staples","1,160,000","2014","Staples: Breach may have affected 1.16 million customers’ cards
Staples said Friday afternoon that nearly 1.16 million customer payment cards may have been affected in a data breach under investigation since October.

The office-supply retailer said two months ago that it was working with law enforcement officials to look into a possible hacking of its customers’ credit card data. Staples said in October that it had learned of a potential data theft at several of its U.S. stores after multiple banks noticed a pattern of payment card fraud suggesting the company computer systems had been breached.

Now, Staples believes that point-of-sale systems at 115 Staples locations were infected with malware that thieves may have used to steal customers’ names, payment card numbers, expiration dates and card verification codes, Staples said on Friday. At all but two of those stores, the malware would have had access to customer data for purchases made between August 10 and September 16 of this year. At the remaining two stores, the malware was active from July 20 through September 16, the company said.

Staples, which has more than 1,400 retail locations, said the data breach impacted stores in 35 states. The company said its investigation found reports of fraudulent card use at four of its Manhattan locations between April and September 2014, although Staples found no evidence of malware at those locations.

“Staples is committed to protecting customer data and regrets any inconvenience caused by this incident,” the company said in its announcement. “Staples has taken steps to enhance the security of its point-of-sale systems, including the use of new encryption tools,”

The company is offering free identity protection services such as credit monitoring, identity theft insurance and a free credit report to any customers who shopped at the affected stores during the time periods when the malware was active. Staples also reiterated that customers are generally not responsible for any fraudulent charges and reminded its customers to monitor their financial accounts for any suspicious activity.

Staples’ stock (SPLS) dipped about 0.5% on Friday, but the company’s shares are actually up more than 40% since news of the possible breach in October.

Cyber security is a hot button issue across corporate America at the moment, especially in light of last month’s debilitating and embarrassing hack at Sony Pictures Entertainment. (Earlier this week, Fortune‘s Dan Primack pondered whether or not the hacks at Sony and elsewhere might actually be a boon to Staples’ business by spurring a renaissance of sorts for paper-based communication as a way of avoiding digital predators.)

For the most part, though, U.S. retailers have been targeted in most of the recent high-profile data breaches, with companies such as Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and Kmart falling victim along with tens of millions of their customers. Meanwhile, in October, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) revealed that hackers gained access to the contact information of roughly 76 million households and another 7 million small businesses through a data breach at the massive bank.

"165","""Gmail""","5,000,000","2014","4.93 million Gmail usernames and passwords published, Google says ‘no evidence’ its systems were compromised
Approximately 4.93 million Gmail usernames and passwords were published to a Russian Bitcoin forum on Tuesday, as first reported by Russian website CNews. That’s the bad news. The good news is that this leak doesn’t seem as massive upon further inspection.

First off, we got in touch with Google regarding the issue. The company does not believe this is the result of any sort of security breach on its end.

“The security of our users’ information is a top priority for us,” a Google spokesperson told TNW. “We have no evidence that our systems have been compromised, but whenever we become aware that accounts may have been, we take steps to help those users secure their accounts.”

Next, since the posting, the forum administrators have purged the passwords from the text file in question, leaving only the logins. Furthermore, tvskit, the forum user who published the file, claimed that some 60 percent of the passwords were valid.

A quick analysis of the text file shows it includes mainly English, Spanish, and Russian accounts, but also that it seems to combine older lists accumulated over a longer period of time. There could thus be a link to hacks of sites unrelated to Gmail or any of Google’s services, especially if users are choosing the same usernames and passwords for other accounts, as well as phishing attacks.

As a result, this leak likely affects significantly fewer than 5 million users. Many have likely changed their passwords, and certain entries could be for suspended accounts, duplicates or simply outdated.

If you want to check whether your account is included in the leak, you can head to isleaked.com and input your email address (English translation here). We wouldn’t necessarily recommend doing so, however (email addresses could always be accumulated for later spamming): changing your password regardless of whether you’re on the list or not can’t hurt.

Google has taken steps to help them secure their accounts and given them usual recommendations to protect their devices from malware. The company also recommended enabling 2-step verification.

Multiple banks say they are seeing evidence that Home Depot stores may be the source of a massive new batch of stolen credit and debit cards that went on sale this morning in the cybercrime underground. Home Depot says that it is working with banks and law enforcement agencies to investigate reports of suspicious activity.

Contacted by this reporter about information shared from several financial institutions, Home Depot spokesperson Paula Drake confirmed that the company is investigating.

“I can confirm we are looking into some unusual activity and we are working with our banking partners and law enforcement to investigate,” Drake said, reading from a prepared statement. “Protecting our customers’ information is something we take extremely seriously, and we are aggressively gathering facts at this point while working to protect customers. If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately. Right now, for security reasons, it would be inappropriate for us to speculate further – but we will provide further information as soon as possible.”

There are signs that the perpetrators of this apparent breach may be the same group of Russian and Ukrainian hackers responsible for the data breaches at Target, Sally Beauty and P.F. Chang’s, among others. The banks contacted by this reporter all purchased their customers’ cards from the same underground store — rescator[dot]cc — which on Sept. 2 moved two massive new batches of stolen cards onto the market.

In what can only be interpreted as intended retribution for U.S. and European sanctions against Russia for its aggressive actions in Ukraine, this crime shop has named its newest batch of cards “American Sanctions.” Stolen cards issued by European banks that were used in compromised US store locations are being sold under a new batch of cards labled “European Sanctions.”

It is not clear at this time how many stores may have been impacted, but preliminary analysis indicates the breach may extend across all 2,200 Home Depot stores in the United States. Home Depot also operates some 287 stores outside the U.S. including in Canada, Guam, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.

This is likely to be a fast-moving story with several updates as more information becomes available. Stay tuned.

Update: 1:50 p.m. ET: Several banks contacted by this reporter said they believe this breach may extend back to late April or early May 2014. If that is accurate — and if even a majority of Home Depot stores were compromised — this breach could be many times larger than Target, which had 40 million credit and debit cards stolen over a three-week period.

SEOUL - The personal data of at least 20 million bank and credit card users in South Korea has been leaked, state regulators said Sunday, one of the country's biggest ever breaches.

Many major firms in the South have seen customers' data leaked in recent years, either by hacking attacks or their own employees.

In the latest case, an employee from personal credit ratings firm Korea Credit Bureau (KCB) has been arrested and accused of stealing the data from customers of three credit card firms while working for them as a temporary consultant.

Seoul's financial regulators on Sunday confirmed the total number of affected users as at least 20 million, in a country of 50 million.

South KoreaThe stolen data includes the customers' names, social security numbers, phone numbers, credit card numbers and expiration dates, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said in a statement.

The employee later sold the data to phone marketing companies, whose managers were also arrested earlier this month, prosecutors and the FSS said.

The information was taken from the internal servers of KB Kookmin Card, Lotte Card and NH Nonghyup Card.

Regulators have launched investigations into security measures at the affected firms, the FSS said.

""The credit card firms will cover any financial losses caused to their customers due to the latest accident,"" it said.

An employee of Citibank Korea was arrested last month for stealing the personal data of 34,000 customers.

In 2012, two South Korean hackers were arrested for data from 8.7 million customers at the nation's second-biggest mobile operator.

In November 2011, Seoul's top games developer Nexon also saw the personal information of 13 million users of its popular online game MapleStory stolen by hackers.

In July the same year, personal data from 35 million users of Cyworld -- the South's social networking site -- was also stolen by hackers.

Personal data stolen includes postal and email addresses, phone numbers, passwords and even favourite toppings
Hackers have demanded a ransom of €30,000 (£24,000) from Domino's Pizza after stealing personal data on more than 600,000 of its French and Belgian customers.

The data was allegedly stolen during a break-in last week, acknowledged by Domino’s France, which saw 592,000 French and 58,000 Belgian customer records exposed.

A posting by the hackers on text-hosting site Pastebin claims that the stolen data includes customers' full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, delivery instructions and even favourite pizza toppings.

""Domino's Pizza uses an encryption system for data. However, we suffered a hack by seasoned professionals and it is likely that they could decode the encryption system including passwords,"" admitted the official Twitter account for Domino’s France.

“This is why we recommend that you change your password for security reasons. We strongly regret this situation and take illegal access very seriously.""

'Domino's Pizza has until Monday at 8PM CET to pay us'
The hackers, a group calling themselves Rex Mundi, posted a sample of the stolen user data along with a demand for €30,000 to not publish the full set.

“If you're a @dominos_pizzafr customer, u may want to know that we have offered Domino's not to publish your data in exchange for €30,000,” Rex Mundi posted on Twitter before its account was suspended.

“Domino's Pizza has until Monday at 8PM CET to pay us. If they do not do so, we will post the entirety of the data in our possession on the internet,” the hackers said.

Domino’s Netherlands spokesperson Andre ten Wolde told De Standaard that the company would not be paying the ransom and that financial data had not been stolen.

'Theft of personal information is bad news'
A Domino’s UK spokesperson said that Domino’s France and Belgium are not part of the same franchise group as Domino’s Pizza in the UK, which is operated by Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, which holds the “master franchise” for Domino’s Pizza in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Monaco.

It is currently unknown whether user data from Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Monaco was also compromised.

Domino’s Pizza Group owns and operates the Domino’s Pizza franchises in the UK and Ireland as well as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.

“The data hacking is isolated to the Domino’s franchise in France and Belgium, and no customer credit card or financial information was compromised,"" said a Domino’s Pizza Group PLC spokesperson in a statement emailed to the Guardian. ""Domino’s customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland are not affected by this incident. The security of customer information is very important to us. We regularly test our UK website for penetration as part of the ongoing rigorous checks and continual routine maintenance of our online operations.”

“Once again we have an example of how customer data, if not adequately secured, can fall into the wrong hands,” said David Emm, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “The fact that credit card details and other financial data weren’t stolen in this case is good, but the theft of personal information is bad news for customers too.”

The Domino’s Pizza break-in is the latest attempt by the hacker group Rex Mundi to extort money from global companies by stealing user data. In 2012, the group stole and published online loan-applicant details from thousands of users from US payday loan company AmeriCash Advance.

Belgian internet hosting company Alfa Hosting became another of Rex Mundi’s victims suffering a break-in this year leading to the names of 12,000 customers being published online.

“One of the possibly more concerning things is that in a copy of the original notice the hacker group published, the passwords appear to be in plain text,"" said Jon French, security analyst at AppRiver. ""It’s possible they cracked or used rainbow tables to get the passwords, but if the passwords were actually stored in plain text, that’s a big no-no on Dominos part.""

'Path of least resistance'
“Cybercriminals are after the money and will follow the path of least resistance to get to it. Usually this means stealing personal data which is often unencrypted and selling it on the black market, or in this case using it for cyber blackmail,” Jason Hart, vice president of Cloud Solutions at SafeNet.

“The latest breach continues to raise public awareness of the need for encryption – not just of financial data, but also wider customer information. Breaches will happen and you can’t stop them. The issue is – are you able to protect your sensitive data when a breach happens?” explained Hart.

Feedly, Evernote and many other sites and online services have recently been targets for extortion, with hackers demanding money to avoid being taken offline by distributed denial of service attacks, which overload the servers of the website or service, preventing users from access it.

“This is slightly different to what we saw last week, when Feedly and Evernote were targeted by DDoS extortion attacks,” explained George Anderson, director of security firm Webroot.

“Usually, organisations that give in and pay are spared being DDoSed – but only because following through with a DDoS attack requires slightly more effort on the hackers’ side, than publishing the data that has already been downloaded.”

“Companies that fall victim to money extortion attacks should under no circumstances agree to play by hackers’ terms,” Anderson said.

"169","Mozilla","76,000","2014","Mozilla confirms leak of 76,000 developer email addresses
The not-for-profit foundation behind the Firefox browser has admitted a serious data leak, exposing developers’ contacts and encrypted passwords

Members of Mozilla’s developer community have been alerted about an accidental leak of email addresses and encrypted passwords, after the failure of a “data sanitisation” process the organisation was carrying out.

Mozilla, which is most famous for its Firefox web browser, co-ordinates the development of a number of open-source software projects through the Mozilla Developer Network.

“Starting on about 23 June, for a period of 30 days,” the organisation warned developers, “a data sanitisation process … had been failing, resulting in the accidental disclosure of MDN email addresses of about 76,000 users and encrypted passwords of about 4,000 users on a publicly accessible server.”

The passwords were stored as salted hashes, an encryption process which renders it computationally impossible to retrieve the original password in a readable format, and Mozilla says that, by themselves, they “cannot be used to authenticate with the MDN website today”.

But it adds that “it is possible that some MDN users could have reused their original MDN passwords on other non-Mozilla websites or authentication systems”.

Stormy Peters, the company’s director of developer relations, says that “as soon as we learned of [the leak], the database dump file was removed from the server immediately, and the process that generates the dump was disabled to prevent further disclosure.

“While we have not been able to detect malicious activity on that server, we cannot be sure there wasn’t any such access.”

Beard confirmed as new CEO
The Mozilla Foundation recently named Chris Beard, its interim CEO, as the new permanent head of the Mozilla Corporation – a for-profit wholly owned subsidiary which publishes the Firefox browser.

Beard had replaced Brendan Eich as CEO on a temporary basis in April, after the latter resigned owing to controversy surrounding his donations to a campaign against same sex marriage.

“We know why people are hurt and angry, and they are right: it’s because we haven’t stayed true to ourselves,” said Mitchell Baker, the Mozilla Foundation’s executive chairwoman, at the time. “We didn’t act like you’d expect Mozilla to act. We didn’t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We’re sorry. We must do better.”

Confirming that Beard was to stay on as CEO on a permanent basis, Baker said in a blog post that “over the years, Chris has led many of Mozilla’s most innovative projects.

“We have relied on his judgment and advice for nearly a decade. Chris has a clear vision of how to take Mozilla’s mission and turn it into industry-changing products and ideas.”

Cyberattacks on businesses have, regrettably, become all too common. We understand that news of a cyberattack on CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield (CareFirst) is a cause of concern for our members and others with whom we do business. Maintaining the privacy and security of our members’ personal information is one of our highest priorities.

Limited personal information was involved in this attack – for instance, no member Social Security Numbers, medical claims information or financial information was put at risk. While this reduces the chance that your personal information will be used improperly, we are nonetheless offering our potentially affected members two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services in order to ease your concerns about possible unauthorized use of your personal information.

Information About The Cyberattack on CareFirst
On May 20, 2015, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield (CareFirst) announced that the company has been the target of a sophisticated cyberattack.

The attackers gained limited, unauthorized access to a single CareFirst database. This was discovered as a part of the company’s ongoing Information Technology (IT) security efforts in the wake of recent cyberattacks on health insurers. CareFirst engaged Mandiant – one of the world’s leading cybersecurity firms – to conduct an end-to-end examination of its IT environment. This review included multiple, comprehensive scans of the CareFirst’s IT systems for any evidence of a cyberattack.

The review determined that in June 2014 cyberattackers gained access to a single database in which CareFirst stores data that members and other individuals enter to access CareFirst’s websites and online services. Mandiant completed its review and found no indication of any other prior or subsequent attack or evidence that other personal information was accessed.

Evidence suggests the attackers could have potentially acquired member-created user names created by individuals to access CareFirst’s website, as well as members’ names, birth dates, email addresses and subscriber identification number.

However, CareFirst user names must be used in conjunction with a member-created password to gain access to underlying member data through CareFirst’s website. The database in question did not include these passwords because they are fully encrypted and stored in a separate system as a safeguard against such attacks. The database accessed by attackers contained no member Social Security numbers, medical claims, employment, credit card, or financial information.

“We deeply regret the concern this attack may cause”, said CareFirst President and CEO Chet Burrell. “We are making sure those affected understand the extent of the attack – and what information was and was not affected. Even though the information in question would be of limited use to an attacker, we want to protect our members from any potential use of their information and will be offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for those affected for two years.”

Approximately 1.1 million current and former CareFirst members and individuals who do business with CareFirst online who registered to use CareFirst’s websites prior to June 20, 2014 are affected by this event. All affected members will receive a letter from CareFirst offering two free years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection. The letters will contain an activation code and you must have the letter to enroll in the offered protections. Out of an abundance of caution, CareFirst has blocked member access to these accounts and will request that members create new user names and passwords.

"171","Premera","11,000,000","2015","Premera hack exposes 11 million financial and medical records

US health insurance firm Premera Blue Cross has revealed its IT systems were breached, exposing the financial and medical records of 11 million customers.

Premera Blue Cross said it discovered cyber attackers breached its systems in January 2015. An investigation showed the first attack took place in May 2014.

News of the breach came six weeks after fellow US health insurer Anthem revealed a data breach had hit its systems, affecting 80 million customers and employees.

Security experts predict cyber attacks on health care organisations will grow because of the rich set of personal data they hold.

Premera says it is contacting all customers affected by the attack – but many have criticised the company for taking nearly seven weeks before raising the alarm.

Anthem was praised for alerting customers and employees about its breach within a week of discovering it.

Premera said FireEye’s Mandiant cyber security team is removing malware from company systems and investigating the breach alongside the FBI.

Read more about data breaches
More than 70% of executives say their organisations do not understand fully the risks associated with data breaches.
Most large enterprises already know much of what they need to put in place to protect themselves against data breaches – they just have not done it all.
As data breaches mount, the C-suite is being pressed to take part in enterprise security.
Sensitive personal data breached
Premera said it is also taking action to strengthen and enhance the security of the company’s IT systems.

Affected brands include Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and affiliate brands Vivacity and Connexion Insurance Solutions.

Premera said its investigation showed attackers may have gained unauthorised access to applicants’ and members’ information.

This data could include names, dates of birth, email addresses, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, member identification numbers, bank account information and claims information – including clinical data.

Although fewer records were exposed than in the Anthem breach, the Premera breach could have a much greater impact because it includes medical information.

Medical data can be more valuable to cyber criminals than financial information because it remains valid for a longer period of time and can be used to create false claims and records, say security experts.

The company said individuals who do business with Premera and provided their email address, personal bank account number or social security number are affected.

Premera takes measures to mitigate customers' data breach
But Premera said the investigation has not determined that any such data was removed from its systems, and there is no evidence that such data has been used inappropriately.

In addition to alerting customers affected by the breach, the company is providing two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.

Premera has set up a dedicated callcentre for members and other affected individuals. 

“I recognize the frustration that the news of this cyber attack may cause. The privacy and security of our members' personal information is a top priority for us,” Premera president and chief executive Jeff Roe said in a statement.

“As much as possible, we want to make this event our burden, not yours, by making services available to protect you and your information moving forward.”

Richard Blech, chief executive of security firm Secure Channels, said the Premera breach demonstrated the failure of flawed, outdated assumptions.

The importance of encrypting sensitive data
“These include an over-reliance on ‘guard the door’ entry point security and simplistic single-key encryption schemes – a quaint and dangerous approach to a 21st century problem,” he said.

To be an entrusted safe-keeper of private and sensitive consumer information, Blech said an insurer or provider has to protect said data by encrypting it.

""Responsible insurers and care providers are attuned to the landscape of today’s technologies, increasingly pandemic threat landscape and the responsibilities and consequences that together help define their market,” he said.

Blech said security-as-an-afterthought is not a plan. “Likewise, security at a few single points in the infrastructure is not an answer, it’s an invitation.”

He said that, while there may not be a sustainable way to prevent intrusions, personal data can be secured by encrypting it to the highest levels.

“With advanced and unhackable encryption, the hacker is left with a bunch of useless bits and bytes. The alternative is to continue to leave sensitive data readable – thus hackable – leaving organisations and their patients truly vulnerable,"" said Blech.

"172","Deep Root Analytics","198,000,000","2015","Database of 191 million U.S. voters exposed on Internet: researcher
(Reuters) - An independent computer security researcher uncovered a database of information on 191 million voters that is exposed on the open Internet due to an incorrectly configured database, he said on Monday.
The database includes names, addresses, birth dates, party affiliations, phone numbers and emails of voters in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, researcher Chris Vickery said in a phone interview.

Vickery, a tech support specialist from Austin, Texas, said he found the information while looking for information exposed on the Web in a bid to raise awareness of data leaks.

Vickery said he could not tell whether others had accessed the voter database, which took about a day to download.

While voter data is typically considered public information, it would be time-consuming and expensive to gather a database of all American voters. A trove of all U.S. voter data could be valuable to criminals looking for lists of large numbers of targets for a variety of fraud schemes.

“The alarming part is that the information is so concentrated,” Vickery said.

Vickery said he has not been able to identify who controls the database, but that he is working with U.S. federal authorities to find the owner so they can remove it from public view. He declined to identify the agencies.

A representative with the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.

A representative with the U.S. Federal Elections Commission, which regulates campaign financing, said the agency does not have jurisdiction over protecting voter records.

Regulations on protecting voter data vary from state to state, with many states imposing no restrictions. California, for example, requires that voter data be used for political purposes only and not be available to persons outside of the United States.

Privacy advocates said Vickery’s findings were troubling.

“Privacy regulations are required so a person’s political information can be kept private and safe,” said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Digital Democracy. The leak was first reported by CSO Online and Databreaches.net, computer and privacy news sites that Vickery said helped him attempt to locate the database’s owner.

CSO Online said the exposed information may have originally come from campaign software provider NationBuilder because the leak included data codes similar to those used by that firm.

In a statement, NationBuilder Chief Executive Officer Jim Gilliam said the database was not created by the Los Angeles-based company, but that some of its information may have come from data it freely supplies to political campaigns.

“From what we’ve seen, the voter information included is already publicly available from each state government, so no new or private information was released in this database,” Gilliam said.

"173","Invest Bank","40,000","2015","After asking UAE bank for $3 million ransom, hacker dumps tens of thousands of customers’ transactions history online
He calls himself Hacker Buba, and he’s shared tens of thousands of customers’ complete financial information.

Just over week after a hacker breached a United Arab Emirates Bank, demanding a ransom to stop tweeting customers’ information, he appears to have dumped tens of thousands of customer files online.

As captured in archived tweets on since-deleted accounts, a user identifying himself as “Hacker Buba” tweeted information, mostly of corporate accounts, that was reportedly stolen from Invest Bank. He told Mazhar Farooqui, editor of the Dubai-based XPress newspaper, that he had an audacious scheme: if he wasn’t paid $3 million in Bitcoin, he’d keep leaking that information. One bank executive confirmed the hack to Farooqui, adding that, “This is blackmail.”

Multiple employees at the bank—which is unmentioned in the XPress report, but repeatedly referred to by Hacker Buba as the 40-year-old, Sharjah-based Invest Bank—didn’t respond to the Daily Dot’s request for comment. Neither did the two government agencies that the banking official said he’d referred the case to. But it appears that the bank didn’t actually pony up the full ransom, because someone claiming to be Hacker Buba has posted customer databases online.

The means by which that information was posted is striking. Hacker Buba initially tweeted from accounts like @investbank_2, though those were quickly deleted. But late Tuesday night and then again on Wednesday, approximately 50 seemingly unrelated Twitter accounts began tweeting the same message, which included both the name Invest Bank and a link to a site, signed Hacker Buba, that had six zip files purporting to obtain that vast bank information.

The way that information was stored is even more bizarre. It sat—and still does, as of this writing—on the website of an eastern European basketball team, apparently also hacked by Buba and used as a temporary storage space. The administrators of that website also didn’t respond to request for comment.

The actual data appears to be real. And it’s vast. One database analyzed by the Daily Dot includes the sensitive information of around 40,000 customers, including their full names, credit card numbers, and birthdays. One account contained 4,7174,962.38 dirham, or $12,844,589.77. Those accounts’ total earnings add up to $110,736,002.

Other databases show information for other customers, and include detailed transaction histories.

We’ll update if we receive comment from Invest Bank or Hacker Buba.

Update 11:01am CT, Dec. 5: In an email to the Daily Dot, Invest Bank Assistant Manager for General Operations Qasim Kazmi said that paying Hacker Buba’s ransom was out of the question: “No we have not paid nor do we intend to or negotiate with blackmailers.”

The hacked site where Buba had stored the files apparently regained some control, and now is visible only to users with login credentials. ","financial","4",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

Database storing 3.3 million sanriotown.com accounts found online
A database for sanriotown.com, the official online community for Hello Kitty and other Sanrio characters, has been discovered online by researcher Chris Vickery. The database houses 3.3 million accounts and has ties to a number of other Hello Kitty portals.

Vickery contacted Salted Hash and Databreaches.net about the leaked data Saturday evening.

The records exposed include first and last names, birthday (encoded, but easily reversible Vickery said), gender, country of origin, email addresses, unsalted SHA-1 password hashes, password hint questions, their corresponding answers, and other data points that appear to be website related.

[ Prepare to become a Certified Information Security Systems Professional with this comprehensive online course from PluralSight. Now offering a 10-day free trial! ]
Vickery also noted that accounts registered through the fan portals of the following websites were also impacted by this leak: hellokitty.com; hellokitty.com.sg; hellokitty.com.my; hellokitty.in.th; and mymelody.com.

In addition to the primary sanriotown database, two additional backup servers containing mirrored data were also discovered. The earliest logged exposure of this data is November 22, 2015.

In order to prevent identification of the database, Salted Hash is withholding screenshots of the data, IP information, DNS data, and other identifying markers.

Sanrio, as well as the ISP being used to host the database itself, have all been notified. An automated email from the ISP confirmed that the incident notification was logged, but no further details are available.

[ Learnhow to protect personally identifiable information (PII) under GDPR. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters. ]

The Hello Kitty brand is highly popular the world over, to kids and adults, so the immediate concern is that the database might contain the personal information of children.

The recent VTech data breach exposed 11.6 million people, and 6.4 million of them were children. We've asked Sanrio to confirm if there were minors in the database, and the exact count if so. This post will be updated as new information emerges.

In the meantime, it might be wise to take some basic precautions.

If you or your child are registered on sanriotown.com or any of the related domains, it might be best to make sure that you're not using the same password on critical websites, such as those related to financial matters, email, or social media.

In the event that such overlap exists, then you should change your passwords immediately. Moreover, if you use the same hint question and answer across all websites, or related hints and questions, it's a good idea to change those as well.

If the option is available, you should strongly consider using two-factor authentication. Most banks and social media websites offer this feature.

While having sensitive details exposed is bad enough for adults, when the information relates to a child – it's worse. If someone managed to compromise a child's identity, the fraud might not be detected for years, because most parents don't monitor their child's credit record.

Given the way things have been, considering all the data breaches in the last year or two, It might be a good idea to start doing so. Yearly credit reports are free, and victims of identity theft can obtain access to all necessary reports at not cost.

More information is available at Consumer.gov.

Update: Shortly after this article was published, Vickery contacted Salted Hash to report that the passwords were in fact SHA-1 hashes, and not MD5 as he had previously stated.

Update 2: Earlier this afternoon, Chris Vickery confirmed that the three IP addresses that were disclosing user information have been secured. The issue wasn't a hack, but a misconfigured MongoDB installation.

The source of the configuration error isn't clear, as neither the ISP nor Sanrio has answered questions on the matter. However, Sanrio did issue a brief statement to the media:

""The alleged security breach of the SanrioTown site is currently under investigation. Information will be made available once confirmed.""

This is the second time Sanrio has had to deal with a database leaking information. Earlier this year, the company investigated a database leak that exposed information on more than 6,000 shareholders.

Update 3:

In an email to Salted Hash on Tuesday, Sanrio confirmed the exposed Hello Kitty database contained information on 186,261 minors, or those under the age of 18.

That's the bad news.

The good news is that, as mentioned yesterday, the leaked databases have been secured and the company's investigation so far shows that Vickery was the only person to have accessed the data.

Sanrio says the investigation is ongoing, so SanrioTown.com users are being encouraged to change their passwords, especially if they share those passwords with any other website. In addition the email says that it's ""possible (but not yet certain) that maintenance conducted on November 20th resulted in the database becoming accessible.""

As reported in the original story, there are no financial records in the exposed database, and only the previously mentioned personal information was exposed.","tech","2",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

Biggest ever cyber-attack targeting children sees private information stolen including photos and addresses as well as the information of 4.9 million parents

Toymaker VTech will be investigated by several US states after a hack that exposed the private data of 6.4 million children, including photos and addresses.

Attorneys general of Connecticut and Illinois said they will investigate the breach, the largest known hack targeting children, which exposed the private data of more children than the 4.9 million adults caught in the hack.

The attack on the Hong Kong-based company’s portal used to download games to its computer tablets saw the hackers steal photos and chat logs along with a customer database.

The personal information stolen, which was not encrypted, included names, email addresses, passwords, secret questions and answers for password retrieval, IP addresses, postal addresses, download histories and children’s names, genders and birth dates, according to VTech.

A spokeswoman for Connecticut’s attorney general said: “The disclosure of the scope of the breach is troubling.”

The Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner Stephen Wong said his office had initiated a “compliance check” on VTech to see if the company had followed data privacy principles. Security experts said they expected the size of the breach would prompt governments to scrutinise VTech and other toymakers to review their security.

Tod Beardsley, security research manager with Rapid7 Inc, said: “VTech is a toymaker and I don’t expect them to be security superstars. They are amateurs in the field of security.”

Seth Chromick, a threat analyst with network security firm vArmour said: “This breach is a parent’s nightmare of epic proportions. A different approach to security for all organisations is needed.”

Chris Wysopal, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Veracode, said it could be a wake up call for families in the same way that the hack on infidelity website Ashley Madison exposed cheaters.

Stolen records such as credit card details and personal information are available online for around £1 each, while records and photos of minors could be worth considerably more on the darkweb, experts say.","tech","5",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"176","Hacking Team","500,000","2015","Hacking Team hacked: firm sold spying tools to repressive regimes, documents claim
Cybersecurity firm has 400GB of what purport to be its own documents published via its Twitter feed after hack

The cybersecurity firm Hacking Team appears to have itself been the victim of a hack, with documents that purport to show it sold software to repressive regimes being posted to the company’s own Twitter feed.

The Italy-based company offers security services to law enforcement and national security organisations. It offers legal offensive security services, using malware and vulnerabilities to gain access to target’s networks.

According to the documents, 400GB of which have been published, Hacking Team has also been working with numerous repressive governments – something it has previously explicitly denied doing. It has not been possible to independently verify the veracity of the documents.

The perpetrators of the apparent hack used the company’s own official Twitter feed (renamed “Hacked Team”) to communicate. They continued to post to the feed for hours after, highlighting specific documents they claim come from the hack, such as emails, invoices and even screenshots of Hacking Team employees’ computers, until the company regained control on Monday morning and removed the posts.

One such tweet, which has since been removed, purports to show Hacking Team negotiating with a third-party reseller to export its malware to Nigeria. If the sale took place, it may have bypassed Italian export controls. Another is claimed to show the company debating what to do after an independent investigation from the University of Toronto attacked it for selling hacking tools to Ethiopia, which then used it to target journalists in the US and elsewhere. The company has never publicly confirmed nor denied working with Ethopia, and  earlier reports as “based on some nicely presented suppositions”.

One of the now-deleted tweets from @hackingteam.

The company has repeatedly denied selling its technology to repressive regimes. In 2013, a Reporters Without Borders report that named Hacking Team as one of the “corporate enemies of the internet” for its position as a “digital mercenary” prompted a response from the firm. In a statement, it said: “Hacking Team goes to great lengths to assure that our software is not sold to governments that are blacklisted by the EU, the USA, Nato and similar international organisations or any ‘repressive’ regime.”

But, if genuine, the leaked documents suggest that among Hacking Team’s clients are the governments and security services of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, many of whom have been criticised by international human rights organisations for their aggressive surveillance of citizens, activists and journalists both domestically and overseas.

Most notably, the documents include an invoice for €480,000, which purports to be from the Sudanese national intelligence service, dated June 2012. Three years later, in January 2015, the company told the UN’s Italian representative that it had no current business relations with the country, prompting the follow-up question “as to whether there have any previous business arrangements” with Sudan, the answer to which is not recorded.

A separate document contained in the apparent file dump appears to show Sudan, along with Russia, listed as “not officially supported”, as opposed to the “active” or “expired” status held by most other nation states.

The company describes itself as in the business of “providing tools to police organisations and other government agencies that can prevent crimes or terrorism”, but if the documents are genuine they suggest it may be willing to sell to non-state actors as well. One invoice apparently reveals the company dealing with a private Brazilian firm, YasNiTech, to whom it sold three months access to its remote access tool, allowing the firm to hack in to Android and Blackberry phones, and Windows devices. We do not know if this sale was part of a wider contract with the Brazilian government.

Hacking Team is one of a number of security firms that sell surveillance technology and malware to national governments, enabling them to access the computers of their targets. Gamma International, another firm in the same space that was best known for its FinFisher surveillance software, suffered a similar hack in 2014. In the 40GB of data on FinFisher leaked, the company’s clients, capabilities and pricing was revealed; according to the leaked documents, Hacking Team was celebrating the demise of “a wannabe competitor of ours”. The hacker behind the Gamma International hack has now claimed responsibility for the Hacking Team leak as well, according to Motherboard’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai.

Hacking Team refused to give comment over the phone, directing the Guardian to an email address. Multiple emails to that address and others given on the firm’s website were returned as undeliverable, and on a follow-up call, Hacking Team again declined to comment and directed the paper to the broken email address. When the Guardian explained that the email address was not working, Hacking Team declined to give an alternative address or any other form of contact.

Christian Pozzi, one of the firm’s employees, tweeted to say that the documents contained “false lies” about the services the company offers.

“A lot of what the attackers are claiming regarding our company is not true. Please stop spreading false lies about the services we offer,” Pozzi tweeted. “We are currently working closely with the police at the moment. I can’t comment about the recent breach.”

Pozzi’s feed was later itself hacked, and later still the entire account was deleted.

Privacy groups have welcomed a rare chance to potentially look inside the workings of a cyber-surveillance company such as Hacking Team. Privacy International said in a statement: “Yesterday’s leak of materials reportedly shows how Hacking Team assisted some of the world’s most repressive regimes – from Bahrain to Uzbekistan, Ethiopia to Sudan – to spy on their citizens.

“We know from investigations by Citizen Lab that these tools are used to target human rights activists and pro-democracy supporters at home and abroad. Surveillance companies like Hacking Team have shown they are incapable of responsibly regulating themselves, putting profit over ethics, time after time. Since surveillance companies continue to ignore their role in repression, democratic states must step in to halt their damaging business practices.”

"177","AshleyMadison.com","37,000,000","2015","Online Cheating Site AshleyMadison Hacked

Large caches of data stolen from online cheating site AshleyMadison.com have been posted online by an individual or group that claims to have completely compromised the company’s user databases, financial records and other proprietary information. The still-unfolding leak could be quite damaging to some 37 million users of the hookup service, whose slogan is “Life is short. Have an affair.”

The data released by the hacker or hackers — which self-identify as The Impact Team — includes sensitive internal data stolen from Avid Life Media (ALM), the Toronto-based firm that owns AshleyMadison as well as related hookup sites Cougar Life and Established Men.

Reached by KrebsOnSecurity late Sunday evening, ALM Chief Executive Noel Biderman confirmed the hack, and said the company was “working diligently and feverishly” to take down ALM’s intellectual property. Indeed, in the short span of 30 minutes between that brief interview and the publication of this story, several of the Impact Team’s Web links were no longer responding.

“We’re not denying this happened,” Biderman said. “Like us or not, this is still a criminal act.”

Besides snippets of account data apparently sampled at random from among some 40 million users across ALM’s trio of properties, the hackers leaked maps of internal company servers, employee network account information, company bank account data and salary information.

The compromise comes less than two months after intruders stole and leaked online user data on millions of accounts from hookup site AdultFriendFinder.

In a long manifesto posted alongside the stolen ALM data, The Impact Team said it decided to publish the information in response to alleged lies ALM told its customers about a service that allows members to completely erase their profile information for a $19 fee.

According to the hackers, although the “full delete” feature that Ashley Madison advertises promises “removal of site usage history and personally identifiable information from the site,” users’ purchase details — including real name and address — aren’t actually scrubbed.

“Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It’s also a complete lie,” the hacking group wrote. “Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is of course the most important information the users want removed.”

Their demands continue:

“Avid Life Media has been instructed to take Ashley Madison and Established Men offline permanently in all forms, or we will release all customer records, including profiles with all the customers’ secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails. The other websites may stay online.”

It’s unclear how much of the AshleyMadison user account data has been posted online. For now, it appears the hackers have published a relatively small percentage of AshleyMadison user account data and are planning to publish more for each day the company stays online.

“Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion,” the hackers continued. “Too bad for ALM, you promised secrecy but didn’t deliver. We’ve got the complete set of profiles in our DB dumps, and we’ll release them soon if Ashley Madison stays online. And with over 37 million members, mostly from the US and Canada, a significant percentage of the population is about to have a very bad day, including many rich and powerful people.”

ALM CEO Biderman declined to discuss specifics of the company’s investigation, which he characterized as ongoing and fast-moving. But he did suggest that the incident may have been the work of someone who at least at one time had legitimate, inside access to the company’s networks — perhaps a former employee or contractor.

“We’re on the doorstep of [confirming] who we believe is the culprit, and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication,” Biderman said. “I’ve got their profile right in front of me, all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.”

As if to support this theory, the message left behind by the attackers gives something of a shout out to ALM’s director of security.

“Our one apology is to Mark Steele (Director of Security),” the manifesto reads. “You did everything you could, but nothing you could have done could have stopped this.”

Several of the leaked internal documents indicate ALM was hyper aware of the risks of a data breach. In a Microsoft Excel document that apparently served as a questionnaire for employees about challenges and risks facing the company, employees were asked “In what area would you hate to see something go wrong?”

Trevor Stokes, ALM’s chief technology officer, put his worst fears on the table: “Security,” he wrote. “I would hate to see our systems hacked and/or the leak of personal information.”

In the wake of the AdultFriendFinder breach, many wondered whether AshleyMadison would be next. As the Wall Street Journal noted in a May 2015 brief titled “Risky Business for AshleyMadison.com,” the company had voiced plans for an initial public offering in London later this year with the hope of raising as much as $200 million.

“Given the breach at AdultFriendFinder, investors will have to think of hack attacks as a risk factor,” the WSJ wrote. “And given its business’s reliance on confidentiality, prospective AshleyMadison investors should hope it has sufficiently, er, girded its loins.”

Update, 8:58 a.m. ET: ALM has released the following statement about this attack:

“We were recently made aware of an attempt by an unauthorized party to gain access to our systems. We immediately launched a thorough investigation utilizing leading forensics experts and other security professionals to determine the origin, nature, and scope of this incident.”

“We apologize for this unprovoked and criminal intrusion into our customers’ information. The current business world has proven to be one in which no company’s online assets are safe from cyber-vandalism, with Avid Life Media being only the latest among many companies to have been attacked, despite investing in the latest privacy and security technologies.”

“We have always had the confidentiality of our customers’ information foremost in our minds, and have had stringent security measures in place, including working with leading IT vendors from around the world. As other companies have experienced, these security measures have unfortunately not prevented this attack to our system.”

“At this time, we have been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorized access points. We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyber–terrorism will be held responsible.”

“Avid Life Media has the utmost confidence in its business, and with the support of leading experts in IT security, including Joel Eriksson, CTO, Cycura, we will continue to be a leader in the services we provide. “I have worked with leading companies around the world to secure their businesses. I have no doubt, based on the work I and my company are doing, Avid Life Media will continue to be a strong, secure business,” Eriksson said.”

Hackers with suspected links to China appear to have accessed sensitive data on US intelligence and military personnel, American officials say.

Details of a major hack emerged last week, but officials have now given details of a potential second breach.

It is feared that the attack could leave US security personnel or their families open to blackmail.

The agency involved, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is yet to comment on the reports.

Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press (AP) news agency, believe the attackers have targeted the forms submitted by intelligence and military personnel for security clearances.

The document includes personal information - everything from eye colour, to financial history, to past substance abuse, as well as contact details for the individual's friends and relatives.

Loans and drug use

A 127-page vetting document called Standard Form 86 may have been accessed. Among the questions potential employees are asked:

In the past seven years, have you defaulted on any loans?
Have you ever voluntarily sought counselling or treatment as a result of your use of alcohol?
In the last seven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substance?
A White House statement said investigators had a ""high degree of confidence"" that background information on government employees had been accessed.

Joel Brenner, a former US counterintelligence official, called the data a ""gold mine"" for hackers.

It is also believed the breach of personal data of US government workers announced last week may be far larger than previously reported.

Initial estimates put the number of people potentially affected at four million, but officials close to the investigation told AP that as many as 14 million might be involved.

Hackers working for the Chinese state breached the computer system of the Office of Personnel Management in December, U.S. officials said Thursday, and the agency will notify about 4 million current and former federal employees that their personal data may have been compromised.

The hack was the largest breach of federal employee data in recent years. It was the second major intrusion of the same agency by China in less than a year and the second significant foreign breach into U.S. government networks in recent months.Last year, Russia compromised White House and State Department e-mail systems in a campaign of cyber­espionage.

[What to do if your information was stolen]

The OPM, using new tools, discovered the breach in April, according to officials at the agency who declined to discuss who was behind the hack.

Other U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation, identified the hackers as being state-sponsored.

One private security firm, iSight Partners, says it has linked the OPM intrusion to the same cyber­espionage group that hacked the health insurance giant Anthem. The FBI suspects that that intrusion, announced in February, was also the work of Chinese hackers, people close to the investigation have said.

The intruders in the OPM case gained access to information that included employees’ Social Security numbers, job assignments, performance ratings and training information, agency officials said. OPM officials declined to comment on whether payroll data was exposed other than to say that no direct-
deposit information was compromised. They could not say for certain what data was taken, only what the hackers gained access to.

“Certainly, OPM is a high-value target,” Donna Seymour, the agency’s chief information officer, said in an interview. “We have a lot of information about people, and that is something that our adversaries want.”

The personal information exposed could be useful in crafting “spear-phishing” e-mails, which are designed to fool recipients into opening a link or an attachment so that the hacker can gain access to computer systems. Using the stolen OPM data, for instance, a hacker might send a fake e-mail purporting to be from a colleague at work.

After the earlier breach discovered in March 2014, the OPM undertook “an aggressive effort to update our cybersecurity posture, adding numerous tools and capabilities to our networks,” Seymour said. “As a result of adding these tools, we were able to detect this intrusion into our networks.”

“Protecting our federal employee data from malicious cyber incidents is of the highest priority at OPM,” Director Katherine Archuleta said in a statement.

In the current incident, the hackers targeted an OPM data center housed at the Interior Department. The database did not contain information on background investigations or employees applying for security clear­ances, officials said.

By contrast, in March 2014, OPM officials discovered that hackers had breached an OPM system that manages sensitive data on federal employees applying for clearances. That often includes financial data, information about family and other sensitive details. That breach, too, was attributed to China, other officials said. OPM officials declined to comment on whether the data affected in this incident was encrypted or had sensitive details masked. They said it appeared that the intruders are no longer in the system.

“There is no current activity,” an official said. But Chinese hackers frequently try repeat intrusions.

[The real story of how the Internet became so vulnerable]

Seymour said the agency is working to better protect the data stored in its servers throughout the government, including by using data masking or redaction. “We’ve purchased tools to be able to implement that capability for all” the data, she said.

Among the steps taken to protect the network, the OPM restricted remote access to the network by system administrators, officials said. When the OPM discovered the breach, it notified the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.

A senior DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said the “good news” is that the OPM discovered the breach using the new tools. “These things are going to keep happening, and we’re going to see more and more because our detection techniques are improving,” the official said.

FBI spokesman Josh Campbell said his agency is working with DHS and OPM officials to investigate the incident. “We take all potential threats to public- and private-sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,” he said.

The intruders used a “zero-day” — a previously unknown cyber-tool — to take advantage of a vulnerability that allowed the intruders to gain access into the system.

[Why the Internet’s massive flaws may never get fixed]

China is one of the most aggressive nations targeting U.S. and other Western states’ networks. In May 2014, the United States announced the indictments of five Chinese military officials for economic cyber­espionage — hacking into the computers of major steel and other companies and stealing plans, sensitive negotiating details and other information.

“China is everywhere,” said Austin Berglas, head of cyber investigations at K2 Intelligence and a former top cyber official at the FBI’s New York field office. “They’re looking to gain social and economic and political advantage over the United States in any way they can. The easiest way to do that is through theft of intellectual property and theft of sensitive information.”

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the past few months have seen a massive series of data breaches affecting millions of Americans.

“This latest intrusion . . . is among the most shocking because Americans may expect that federal computer networks are maintained with state-of-the-art defenses,” he said. “The cyberthreat from hackers, criminals, terrorists and state actors is one of the greatest challenges we face on a daily basis, and it’s clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defenses is perilously overdue.”

Colleen M. Kelley, president of the nation’s ­second-largest federal worker union, the National Treasury Employees Union, said her organization “is very concerned” about the breach. “Data security, particularly in an era of rising incidence of identity theft, is a critically important matter,” she said.

“It is vital to know as soon as possible the extent to which, if any, personal information may have been obtained so that affected employees can be notified promptly and encouraged to take all possible steps to protect themselves from financial or other risks,” she said.

Exclusive: Obama, Putin, Merkel, Cameron, Modi and others kept in the dark after passport numbers and other details were disclosed in Australia’s accidental privacy breach

The personal details of world leaders at the last G20 summit were accidentally disclosed by the Australian immigration department, which did not consider it necessary to inform those world leaders of the privacy breach.

The Guardian can reveal an employee of the agency inadvertently sent the passport numbers, visa details and other personal identifiers of all world leaders attending the summit to the organisers of the Asian Cup football tournament.

The United States president, Barack Obama, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, and the British prime minister, David Cameron, were among those who attended the Brisbane summit in November and whose details were exposed.

The Australian privacy commissioner was contacted by the director of the visa services division of Australia’s Department of Immigration and Border Protection to inform them of the data breach on 7 November 2014 and seek urgent advice.

In an email sent to the commissioner’s office, obtained under Australia’s freedom of information laws, the breach is attributed to an employee who mistakenly emailed a member of the local organising committee of the Asian Cup – held in Australia in January – with the personal information.

“The personal information which has been breached is the name, date of birth, title, position nationality, passport number, visa grant number and visa subclass held relating to 31 international leaders (ie prime ministers, presidents and their equivalents) attending the G20 leaders summit,” the officer wrote.

“The cause of the breach was human error. [Redacted] failed to check that the autofill function in Microsoft Outlook had entered the correct person’s details into the email ‘To’ field. This led to the email being sent to the wrong person.

“The matter was brought to my attention directly by [redacted] immediately after receiving an email from [the recipient] informing them that they had sent the email to the wrong person.

“The risk remains only to the extent of human error, but there was nothing systemic or institutional about the breach.”

The officer wrote that it was “unlikely that the information is in the public domain”, and said the absence of other personal identifiers “limits significantly” the risk of the breach. The unauthorised recipient had deleted the email and “emptied their deleted items folder”.

“The Asian Cup local organising committee do not believe the email to be accessible, recoverable or stored anywhere else in their systems,” the letter said.

The immigration officer then recommended that the world leaders not be made aware of the breach of their personal information.

“Given that the risks of the breach are considered very low and the actions that have been taken to limit the further distribution of the email, I do not consider it necessary to notify the clients of the breach,” she wrote.

The recommendation not to disclose the breach to the world leaders may be at odds with privacy law in some of their countries.

Britain, Germany and France all have different forms of mandatory data breach notification laws that require individuals affected by data breaches to be informed.

It is not clear whether the immigration department subsequently notified the world leaders of the breach after the initial assessment.

The office of the Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, did not respond to questions.

Australia’s deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, called on Tony Abbott to explain why the world leaders were not notified of the breach.

“The prime minister and the immigration minister must explain this serious incident and the decision not to inform those affected,” she said.

Disclosure of the data breach is likely to embarrass the Australian government after controversial mandatory data retention laws were passed last week.

The passage of the laws – which require telecommunications companies to store certain types of phone and web data for two years – has been marked by concerns about the adequacy of privacy safeguards by companies and government agencies that will handle the data.

The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: “Only last week the government was calling on the Australian people to trust them with their online data, and now we find out they have disclosed the details of our world leaders.

“This is another serious gaffe by an incompetent government.”

Australia’s immigration department was also responsible for the country’s largest ever data breach by a government agency.

In February 2014 the Guardian revealed the agency had inadvertently disclosed the personal details of almost 10,000 people in detention – many of whom were asylum seekers – in a public file on its website.

"181","IRS","100,000","2015","Criminals use IRS website to steal data on 104,000 people

A ""sophisticated"" organized crime syndicate used the IRS website to steal tax forms full of personal financial information on 104,000 taxpayers, the agency said Tuesday.

Until the IRS discovered this latest data leak, its website provided a service called ""Get Transcript."" It's an easy way to download several years of tax forms for tasks like applying for a mortgage, or college financial aid.

An unnamed cybermafia used this app to download forms full of personal information. They posed as legitimate taxpayers, and tried to download forms on 200,000 people between February and May. They got away with half of them, the IRS said.

The crooks used about 15,000 of them to claim tax refunds in other people's names.

But the potential damage is worse. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said he believes the criminals' true mission was to gather vast amounts of personal information. Armed with that info, fraudsters can open bank accounts, credit lines and steal tax refunds in the future.

""This is just the latest manifestation of people getting enough data to masquerade as a taxpayer,"" Koskinen said.

Last week, the IRS spotted an odd flood of computer traffic and initially thought its website was facing a cyberattack to block its services. But on further investigation, it discovered that the slew of requests were pulling data from its ""Get Transcript"" service and the agency immediately cut off communication.

This cyberattack wasn't a hack in the traditional sense. The IRS said criminals were able to use the Get Transcript service, because they plugged in personal data they had already stolen: Social Security numbers, birthdays, physical addresses and more. They even answered correctly those personal identity verification questions -- the ones we all know as being too specific, annoying and difficult to answer ourselves.

This shows their intent was to gain even more personal data: accurate salary information, and details on specific tax deductions people take.

It was an attack the agency wasn't well suited to combat, Koskinen said. ""We're dealing with criminals with a lot of money and using expensive equipment and hiring a lot of smart people,"" he said during a conference call Tuesday.

The IRS has temporarily disabled the ""Get Transcript"" service. It was too easy to game, Koskinen said. The agency had tried to make the service difficult for fraudsters -- but not too burdensome for the average person trying to get a hold of previous years' tax returns.

The agency is now trying to increase the security on the app -- and figure out the right balance, Koskinen said.

This is a popular tool. In recent months, Americans used it to download 23 million transcripts, the agency said. Taxpayers can still request previous years' documents, but they'll have to do it via the older and slower process -- by paper.

The IRS said it will notify by mail all 200,000 people who might be affected by this. They will all be placed on a list of Americans whose tax profiles are more closely monitored next year. To assist the victims, the IRS is also offering paid credit protection programs for them.

The agency is offering a secure PIN to the 104,000 whose tax forms the IRS is sure were exposed. It's not offering that protection to the other 100,000 people -- even though they arguably need it too (given that criminals already have their Social Security numbers and can already claim tax refunds in their names).

The PIN program is a permanent security feature that requires taxpayers to use a six-digit passcode when filing taxes. Currently, all that is required is a Social Security number.

PINs are currently only available to tax fraud victims and residents of Florida, Georgia and Washington. The agency wants to take this pilot program nationwide.

Koskinen said there is ""no indication there is any connection"" to the recent wave of fraud involving TurboTax preparation software.

But he said this is just more proof criminals are ramping up their theft of personal data for illicit gain.

""These guys are very good at data analytics. They have volumes of data available they can match up,"" he said. ""The criminals can answer questions better than you can.""

IRS law enforcement agents are now hunting for the fraudsters who did this, and the agency's own internal investigator is looking into how this happened.

"182","MSpy","400,000","2015","Mobile Spyware Maker mSpy Hacked, Customer Data Leaked

mSpy, the makers of a dubious software-as-a-service product that claims to help more than two million people spy on the mobile devices of their kids and partners, appears to have been massively hacked. Last week, a huge trove of data apparently stolen from the company’s servers was posted on the Deep Web, exposing countless emails, text messages, payment and location data on an undetermined number of mSpy “users.”

mSpy has not responded to multiple requests for comment left for the company over the past five days. KrebsOnSecurity learned of the apparent breach from an anonymous source who shared a link to a Web page that is only reachable via Tor, a technology that helps users hide their true Internet address and allows users to host Web sites that are extremely difficult to get taken down.

The Tor-based site hosts several hundred gigabytes worth of data taken from mobile devices running mSpy’s products, including some four million events logged by the software. The message left by the unknown hackers who’ve claimed responsibility for this intrusion suggests that the data dump includes information on more than 400,000 users, including Apple IDs and passwords, tracking data, and payment details on some 145,000 successful transactions.

The exact number of mSpy users compromised could not be confirmed, but one thing is clear: There is a crazy amount of personal and sensitive data in this cache, including photos, calendar data, corporate email threads, and very private conversations. Also included in the data dump are thousands of support request emails from people around the world who paid between $8.33 to as much as $799 for a variety of subscriptions to mSpy’s surveillance software.

It’s unclear exactly where mSpy is based; the company’s Web site suggests it has offices in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, although the firm does not appear to list an official physical address. However, according to historic Web site registration records, the company is tied to a now-defunct firm called MTechnology LTD out of the United Kingdom.

Documents obtained from Companies House, an official register of corporations in the U.K., indicate that the two founding members of the company are self-described programmers Aleksey Fedorchuk and Pavel Daletski. Those records (PDF) indicate that Daletski is a British citizen, and that Mr. Fedorchuk is from Russia. Neither of the men could be reached for comment.

Court documents (PDF) obtained from the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Fla. regarding a trademark dispute involving mSpy and Daletski state that mSpy has a U.S.-based address of 800 West El Camino Real, in Mountain View, Calif. Those same court documents indicate that Daletski is a director at a firm based in the Seychelles called Bitex Group LTD. Interestingly, that lawsuit was brought by Retina-X Studios, an mSpy competitor based in Jacksonville, Fla. that makes a product called MobileSpy.

U.S. regulators and law enforcers have taken a dim view of companies that offer mobile spyware services like mSpy. In September 2014, U.S. authorities arrested a 31-year-old Hammad Akbar, the CEO of a Lahore-based company that makes a spyware app called StealthGenie. The FBI noted that while the company advertised StealthGenie’s use for “monitoring employees and loved ones such as children,” the primary target audience was people who thought their partners were cheating. Akbar was charged with selling and advertising wiretapping equipment.

“Advertising and selling spyware technology is a criminal offense, and such conduct will be aggressively pursued by this office and our law enforcement partners,” U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said in a press release tied to Akbar’s indictment.

Akbar pleaded guilty to the charges in November 2014, and according to the Justice Department he is “the first-ever person to admit criminal activity in advertising and selling spyware that invades an unwitting victim’s confidential communications.”

Unlike Akbar’s StealthGenie and some other mobile spyware products, mSpy advertises that its product works even on non-jailbroken iPhones, giving users the ability to log the device holder’s contacts, call logs, text messages, browser history, events and notes.

“If you have opted to purchase mSpy Without Jailbreak, and you have the mobile user’s iCloud credentials, you will not need physical access to the device,” the company’s FAQ states. “However, there may be some instances where physical access may be necessary. If you purchase mSpy for a jailbroken iOS phone or tablet, you will need 5-15 minutes of physical access to the device for successful installation.”

A public relations pitch from mSpy to KrebsOnSecurity in March 2015 stated that approximately 40 percent of the company’s users are parents interested in keeping tabs on their kids. Assuming that is a true statement, it’s ironic that so many parents have now unwittingly exposed their kids to predators, bullies and other ne’er-do-wells thanks to this breach.

"183","Adult Friend Finder","3,900,000","2015","Adult dating site hack exposes millions of users

The stolen data reveals the sexual preferences of users, whether they’re gay or straight, and even indicates which ones might be seeking extramarital affairs. In addition, the hackers have revealed email addresses, usernames, dates of birth, postal codes and unique internet addresses of users’ computers.

Channel 4 News has been investigating the cyber underworld, discovering which websites have been hacked and exposing the trade in personal information of millions of people through so-called “dark web” sites.

Secretive forum
The investigation led to a secretive forum in which a hacker nicknamed ROR[RG] posted the details of users of Adult FriendFinder. The site boasts 63 million users worldwide and claims more than 7 million British members. It bills itself as a “thriving sex community”, and as a result users often share sensitive sexual information when they sign up.

The information of 3.9m Adult FriendFinder members has been leaked, including those who told the site to delete their accounts.

Shaun Harper is one of those whose details have been published. “The site seemed OK, but when I got into it I realised it wasn’t really for me, I was looking for something longer term. But by that time I’d already given my information. You couldn’t get into the site without handing over information.

“I deleted my account, so I thought the information had gone. These sites are meant to be secure.”

Spam emails
Within hours of the data being leaked, hackers on the forum said they intended to hit victims with spam emails, and Mr Harper has been targeted with virused emails since his information was made public.

Online crime experts believe the after the initial spam email campaign, hackers will now begin trawling through the data for potential blackmail targets. The spreadsheets contain addresses linked to dozens of government and armed services personnel, including members of the British Army.

“Where you’ve got names, dates of birth, ZIP codes, then that provides an opportunity to actually target specific individuals whether they be in government or healthcare for example, so you can profile that person and send more targeted blackmail-type emails,” says Charlie McMurdie, a cybercrime specialist for PwC and former head of the Metropolitan Police‘s electronic crime unit.

The front page of Adult FriendFinder, which is based in California, features photos of dozens of attractive young women. Yet the hacked data, contained in 15 spreadsheets, reveals how few females appear to use Adult FriendFinder.

Among the 26,939 users with a UK email address, for example, there are just 1,596 who identified as female: a ratio of one woman to every 16 men.

FriendFinder Networks Inc, which owns Adult FriendFinder, told Channel 4 News:

“FriendFinder Networks Inc… understands and fully appreciates the seriousness of the issue.

“We have already begun working closely with law enforcement and have launched a comprehensive investigation with the help of leading third-party forensics expert.

“We pledge to take the appropriate steps needed to protect our customers if they are affected.”

"184","Securus Technologies","70,000,000","2015","AN ENORMOUS CACHE of phone records obtained by The Intercept reveals a major breach of security at Securus Technologies, a leading provider of phone services inside the nation’s prisons and jails. The materials — leaked via SecureDrop by an anonymous hacker who believes that Securus is violating the constitutional rights of inmates — comprise over 70 million records of phone calls, placed by prisoners to at least 37 states, in addition to links to downloadable recordings of the calls. The calls span a nearly two-and-a-half year period, beginning in December 2011 and ending in the spring of 2014.

Particularly notable within the vast trove of phone records are what appear to be at least 14,000 recorded conversations between inmates and attorneys, a strong indication that at least some of the recordings are likely confidential and privileged legal communications — calls that never should have been recorded in the first place. The recording of legally protected attorney-client communications — and the storage of those recordings — potentially offends constitutional protections, including the right to effective assistance of counsel and of access to the courts.

“This may be the most massive breach of the attorney-client privilege in modern U.S. history, and that’s certainly something to be concerned about,” said David Fathi, director of the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “A lot of prisoner rights are limited because of their conviction and incarceration, but their protection by the attorney-client privilege is not.”

The blanket recording of detainee phone calls is a fairly recent phenomenon, the official purpose of which is to protect individuals both inside and outside the nation’s prisons and jails. The Securus hack offers a rare look at this little-considered form of mass surveillance of people behind bars — and of their loved ones on the outside — raising questions about its scope and practicality, as well as its dangers.

Securus markets itself to government clients as able to provide a superior phone system — its Secure Call Platform — that allows for broad monitoring and recording of calls. The company also promotes its ability to securely store those recordings, making them accessible only to authorized users within the criminal justice system. Thus, part of the Securus promise is not only that its database is vast, but also that it meets rigorous standards for security. “We will provide the most technologically advanced audio and video communications platform to allow calls with a high level of security,” reads the company’s Integrity Pledge. “We understand that confidentiality of calls is critical, and we will follow all Federal, State, and Local laws in the conduct of our business.”

But the fact that a hacker was able to obtain access to over 70 million prisoner phone call records shows that Securus’ data storage system is far more vulnerable than it purports to be.

More broadly, the Securus leak reveals just how much personal information the company retains about prisoners and the countless people to whom they are connected. It is information that, in the narrow context of incarceration, may not be considered private, but in the larger world raises serious questions about the extent to which people lose their civil liberties when their lives intersect, however briefly, with the criminal justice system.","tech","5",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"185","TalkTalk","157,000","2015","SECURUS IS A TELECOMMUNICATIONS company based in Dallas, Texas, owned by a private equity firm. Its primary business is providing phone and video visitation services to incarcerated people — ostensibly offering a meaningful way for them to keep in touch with loved ones on the outside, as well as to communicate with attorneys. Until now, Securus was probably best-known for the incredibly high rates it has traditionally charged for phone calls, a burden borne almost exclusively by the very people who are the least able to afford it. (The Federal Communications Commission in October voted to cap calling rates and fees, a move that Securus and other industry leaders had fought, claiming the change would have a “devastating effect” on their businesses.)

It isn’t just Securus whose business model has relied on gouging people caught up in the criminal justice system. The industry’s other players, including the leading prison telecom company, Global Tel*Link, largely do the same. Prison and jail communications is a $1.2 billion a year business, whose handsome profits come from serving a captive and inelastic market. According to public relations materials, Securus provides communications platforms used by more than 1.2 million inmates across the country, who are confined in more than 2,200 facilities; by 2012 the company was processing more than 1 million calls each day. In 2014, Securus took in more than $404 million in revenue.

Securus does business with local and county governments (which operate the nation’s jails) and with state departments of correction (which, with some exceptions, run the nation’s prison systems). A key selling point to its clients is that the company not only installs and maintains phone systems at little to no cost to the government, but also that it agrees to pay back to its clients generous “site commissions,” a kickback that comes from revenue generated by inmate calls — on average 42 percent of the revenue from its state contracts, according to research done by Prison Legal News. (The FCC rate caps threaten the industry’s ability to keep revenues large enough to fund the exorbitant kickback scheme it created. Lowering and capping the rates and fees charged for calls means at least some industry players could be forced to dip into company coffers in order to comply with contracted payoff schedules, unless they renegotiate existing contracts. How the new rate caps will impact these payoffs remains to be seen.)


“OMG … this is not good!” reads an internal Securus email discussing phone calls hacked in 2014.
In addition to the sweetheart deal it offers clients, Securus also touts the technology of its Secure Call Platform, which allows recording and monitoring, with few exceptions, of all calls made by prisoners. The superior technology, it claims, ensures that its database is well-protected, and only accessible to authorized users — among them corrections workers, police investigators, and prosecutors. Law enforcement personnel are particularly important to the company: Securus promises it can provide recordings on demand to investigators across jurisdictions, promoting its system as a powerful crime-solving tool.

But the scale of the Securus hack shows the company has failed to fulfill its own promises on security. The more than 70 million phone call records given to The Intercept include phone calls placed to nearly 1.3 million unique phone numbers by more than 63,000 inmates. The original data was contained in a 37-gigabyte file and scattered across hundreds of tables, similar to spreadsheets, which The Intercept merged into a single table containing 144 million records. A search for duplicates reduced this figure to more than 70 million records of individual phone calls.

The database contained prisoners’ first and last names; the phone numbers they called; the date, time, and duration of the calls; the inmates’ Securus account numbers; as well as other information. In addition to metadata, each phone call record includes a “recording URL” where the audio recordings of the calls can be downloaded.

The vast majority of the calls appear to be personal in nature; downloaded audio files leaked alongside the larger database of recordings include one in which a couple has an intimate conversation; in another, relatives discuss someone whose diabetes is worsening. In a third, a couple discusses Dancing With the Stars, TV dinners, and how much money is available to pay for their regular phone conversations — versus how much should instead be spent on food. But a subset of the recordings — a minimum of roughly 14,000 — were made by detainees to attorneys, in calls that range from under a minute to over an hour in length.

To arrive at this figure, The Intercept looked up each of the nearly 1.3 million phone numbers that inmates called in a public directory of businesses to find out whether a law firm or attorney’s office is associated with that number. We found that Securus recorded more than 14,000 phone calls to at least 800 numbers that clearly belonged to attorneys. That 14,000 figure, however, is likely an underestimate because it does not include calls to attorney cellphone numbers. In other words, the 14,000 attorney calls are potentially just a small subset of the attorney-client calls that were hacked.

In short, it turns out that Securus isn’t so secure.

In fact, this doesn’t seem to be the first time that Securus’ supposedly impenetrable system has been hacked. According to documents provided to The Intercept by a Texas attorney, the company’s system was apparently breached just last year, on July 18, 2014, when someone hacked three calls made by an inmate named Aaron Hernandez, presumably the former player for the New England Patriots, who was awaiting trial for killing a friend. In an email thread from July 21, 2014, two Securus employees discuss the breach — the system was accessed by someone in South Dakota, they discover, though they don’t have that person’s name. “OMG……..this is not good!” reads one email contained in the document. “The company will be called to task for this if someone got in there that shouldn’t have been.”

There is no indication the 2014 hack has previously been made public. Securus did not respond to numerous requests for comment for this story. [Editor’s note: See update below for a statement from Securus in response to publication of this story.]

 

PRISONERS DO NOT GENERALLY ENJOY a right to privacy while incarcerated — a fact that is emphasized in the course of virtually any communication with the outside world. Like other jail and prison telecoms, Securus inserts a recorded message at the beginning of each prisoner-initiated phone call, reminding recipients that “this call is from a correctional facility and may be monitored and recorded.” In this context, anyone who hears the warning and still chooses to use the phone has effectively waived a right to privacy during that call, a condition all too familiar to people with incarcerated loved ones. Still, it is hard to imagine that people on either end of the line would ever anticipate that their conversations would be stored for years, in a manner that could potentially expose their intimacies to the larger public. By failing to prevent hackers from accessing the calls, Securus appears to have done just that.

This is troubling to the ACLU’s Fathi, because “waivers of rights are not meant to be all or nothing. Waivers are meant to be only as extensive as necessary to accomplish the goal underlying the waiver,” he said. If the goal for recording and monitoring detainee phone conversations is to enhance safety both inside and outside a facility that’s one thing — but those conversations should not be stored indefinitely, once they’re determined to be free of intelligence that would aide the institutional goal.

The mass recording of detainee calls was originally rationalized as improving safety within a facility — a way to hedge against contraband being brought in, to ferret out escape attempts or potentially violent uprisings, and to curb the possibility of witness tampering or intimidation. But if the goal is to see if a “person is smuggling drugs [or] plotting an escape,” said Fathi, “it doesn’t mean that the prisoner and the … outside person they’re talking to has forever waived all privacy rights and that any conceivable use of that recording is OK.”

The implications are especially alarming for calls that are understood to be the exception to the record-everything rule. Securus’ phone systems are supposed to be set up to allow certain phone numbers to be logged and flagged so that calls to those numbers are exempt from being recorded — let alone stored.

Indeed, that a criminal defendant or inmate should be able to speak frankly and honestly with a lawyer is a cornerstone of the criminal justice system — inherent in a defense attorney’s ethical obligations, and firmly rooted in the Sixth Amendment right to competent and effective legal counsel. A review of contracts and proposals completed by Securus in a handful of states reflects the company’s understanding of this right. In a 2011 bid to provide phone service to inmates in Missouri’s state prisons, Securus promised that each “call will be recorded and monitored, with the exception of privileged calls.” But the database provided to The Intercept shows that over 12,000 recordings of inmate-attorney communications, placed to attorneys in Missouri, were collected, stored, and ultimately hacked.

The data provided to The Intercept also includes at least 27 recordings of calls to attorneys in Austin, Texas, made between December 2011 and October 2013 — a fact that is particularly compelling in light of a federal civil rights suit filed there in 2014 against Securus, which provides phone service to the county’s jails. At the heart of the lawsuit is the allegation that calls to known attorneys have been — and continue to be — recorded. The company’s contract specifically provides that calls “to telephone numbers known to belong [to] attorneys are NOT recorded” and that “if any call to an attorney is inadvertently recorded, the recording is destroyed as soon as it is discovered.”
The lawsuit was brought by the Austin Lawyers Guild, four named attorneys, and a prisoner advocacy group, and alleges that, despite official assurances to the contrary, privileged communications between lawyers and clients housed in the county jails have been taped, stored, “procured,” and listened to by prosecutors. The plaintiffs say that while some prosecutors have disclosed copies of recordings to defense attorneys as part of the regular evidential discovery process, other prosecutors have not, choosing instead to use their knowledge of what is in individual recordings to their “tactical advantage” in the courtroom “without admitting they obtained or listened to the recordings.” (None of the recordings provided to The Intercept appear to be connected to any of the Austin attorneys named in the suit.)

The Austin attorneys argue that the intrusion into their communications with clients undermines their ability to effectively represent them. And those most disproportionately impacted are often clients who are the most disadvantaged: those who can’t afford bail and have to stay in jail awaiting prosecution. Austin defense attorney Scott Smith, who discovered this summer that an intern in the prosecutor’s office had inadvertently listened to a portion of a phone call he had with a jailed client, points out that it rigs the adversarial legal process in favor of the state. “How do you plan your strategy? It’s like being at the Superbowl and one team gets to put a microphone in the huddle of another team.”

Challenging the lawsuit, Securus notes that government intrusion into the attorney-client relationship could be a violation of the Sixth Amendment. But the company insists it has abided by its policy of not recording privileged phone calls — while at the same time maintaining that any existing tapes were voluntarily turned over by the state to defense attorneys during discovery. What’s more, Securus argues that the plaintiffs have not proved that “such recordings” had any adverse effects on their cases. “Securus acknowledges that Plaintiffs have alleged that recorded attorney-client calls have been shared with prosecutors, but they have failed to articulate a single instance where they have been harmed or prejudiced,” Securus said.

Exactly who is to blame for the recording of attorney calls is unclear. In many jurisdictions — including in Austin — the onus is on lawyers or their clients to give phone numbers to prison officials so that they can be placed on a do-not-record list. Failing to provide up-to-date contact information would make any inadvertent recordings the attorney’s or inmate’s fault. But properly logging these numbers is the government’s responsibility. And the secure storage of these is squarely up to Securus — particularly given that it markets itself as providing a service to do exactly that.

IT WASN’T ALWAYS THE CASE that detainee phone calls were recorded in bulk. The practice really took hold in the 1990s, says Martin Horn, a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, who previously served as commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction and, before that, as secretary of corrections in Pennsylvania. When Horn went to Pennsylvania in 1995, the state did not allow for the recording of inmate calls. But that decade saw “numerous horror stories,” he said, of inmates “perpetrating crimes” from within prison, “continuing to run their criminal enterprises” from behind bars, or “threatening witnesses, and so on.” At the same time, telephone technology had evolved significantly, making monitoring, recording, and storage of call data possible.

Until the mid-1980s, inmate phone services were provided by AT&T via operator-assisted collect calls from pay phones. But after the breakup of AT&T the market became more competitive — and less regulated — and companies such as Securus, originally known as the Tele-Matic Corporation, entered the market to offer equipment and, ultimately, sophisticated monitoring systems.

Today, Horn regards call monitoring as an important correctional tool. And while Horn said he was never made aware of any recording of attorney-client communications during his time in corrections, he said to the extent that a privileged communication is either monitored or recorded, there isn’t necessarily a harm — “if in the course of listening to it you become aware that it’s a conversation with a privileged party, such as an attorney, you stop listening,” he said. “So the fact that it was recorded, while unfortunate, you know, isn’t necessarily damaging.”

The hacked database also includes records of calls between prisoners and prosecutors — including 75 calls to a U.S. attorney’s office in Missouri.
But the massive amount of data provided to The Intercept suggests that the scope of surveillance within the system goes far beyond what the original goals might have been. A 2012 Securus contract with the Illinois Department of Corrections describes an optional product called Threads, branding it “one of the most powerful tools in the intelligence community.”

“Securus has the most widely used platform in the industry, with approximately 1,700 facilities installed, over 850,000 inmates served, literally petabytes of intelligence data, and over 1 million calls processed per day,” the company bragged to Illinois officials. “This valuable data is integrated directly into Threads and could be available at [Department of Correction]’s and [Department of Juvenile Justice]’s fingertips.”

Today those numbers are even higher. Securus’ website says that the Threads database contains the billing names and addresses of over half a million people who are not incarcerated, as well as information about more than 950,000 inmates from over 1,900 correctional facilities, and includes over 100 million call records. The amount of data sold to corrections and law enforcement investigators “continues to grow every day.”

As Adina Schwartz, a professor at John Jay College, points out, when you consider that these recordings can be stored “forever, with no supervision,” the potential for abuse increases. “I think any criminal defense attorney who wasn’t worried by that prospect is basically somebody who doesn’t do his or her job.”

And the recordings with known attorneys are not limited to calls with defense lawyers. The hacked database also includes records of calls between prisoners and prosecutors — including 75 calls to a United States attorney’s office in Missouri. These, too, are potentially problematic, particularly if they include conversations with cooperating witnesses who could be vulnerable if the details of their dealings with the government were exposed.

The attorney-client privilege is “the oldest privilege of confidentiality known in our legal system,” said Fathi. In a criminal case it prohibits defense attorneys from divulging, or prosecutors from using, any case-related information that was obtained in confidence. But the reality is that keeping conversations with incarcerated defendants confidential is a challenge. Experts point out that the recorded notice embedded within phone calls initiated inside jails and prisons means that there should be no real expectation of privacy. “If a client is making an out-of-prison call to an attorney, the attorney-client privilege, arguably, doesn’t apply,” said Michael Cassidy, a professor of law at Boston College Law School, because by consenting to speak over a phone line that is subject to recording, the client and attorney should expect that is happening. But that isn’t the end of it: Even if the privilege doesn’t apply, “the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies and the government can’t interfere with it,” he said. “So even if you could argue that notifying a prisoner that their calls are being recorded negates the privilege, it doesn’t negate the Sixth Amendment right to not have the government interfere with counsel.” And monitoring, recording, and potentially using information gleaned from attorney-client calls would do just that.

That’s why prison calling systems, such as Securus’ Secure Call Platform, are set up to log numbers that should not be recorded. “But that’s a technological issue and sometimes it doesn’t work,” said Cassidy.

But Schwartz argues that the logging of attorney phone numbers provides a “recognition that there is attorney-client privilege” and that it is “incumbent on the government to follow through” in protecting that privilege. When attorneys learn that their calls have been recorded, it shakes the foundation of trust, inevitably impinging on their Sixth Amendment obligations. “Once people know there is trickery, there is a chilling of attorney-client communications — because how do you know it won’t happen again?” Schwartz asked.

Indeed, that is precisely the risk that Fathi sees arising from the breach of Securus’ database. “Going forward, prisoners will have very good cause to question whether their phone calls with their attorneys are confidential. And that undermines that very core and fundamental purpose of the attorney-client privilege, which is to allow persons consulting an attorney to give a full and frank account of their legal problem,” he said.

Still, challenging the recording could be tricky, says Cassidy, even if there is clear evidence of taped communications. If a call was recorded because the attorney or client failed to put a phone number on the do-not-record list, he says, then the state is off the hook — a prisoner can’t sue for damages, or seek to have his or her criminal charges dismissed (although the government would still be prohibited from listening to or using the content of the call). However, if one can “show a regular and systemic practice” of recording such calls, a case could be made that “the company is violating multiple prisoners’ Sixth Amendment rights,” which could have more of an impact, perhaps prompting systemwide reforms.

And Fathi believes a case could also be made that the recording and storing of non-attorney calls is unconstitutional. “Prisoners do retain some privacy rights and certainly people on the outside who just happen to be talking to prisoners retain privacy rights. And, again, the fact that you’re passively consenting that the call can be monitored for security purposes doesn’t mean you’re consenting to all conceivable uses of that recording for all time,” he said. “I think even with the non-attorney calls there may be a case to be made that this is just so spectacularly overbroad that it is unconstitutional.”

Indeed, Austin attorney Scott Smith believes that, at least in the nation’s jails — where the majority of inmates are awaiting prosecution and have not yet been found guilty of anything — the blanket recording of phone calls should be stopped. If there are specific detainees worth monitoring, that can be accomplished in a far less intrusive manner, he said. “You can say safety mandates a reduction of civil liberties all the time. And that’s essentially the old debate — how much do you have civil liberties and how much do you need to get rid of them in order to be safe?”

Fathi agrees that the practice of recording detainee phone conversations should be reined in and limited. “It is another manifestation of the exponential growth of the surveillance state. Obviously that’s been noticed and commented upon in other contexts, but if we’re talking about [more than 70] million [calls], even if some of those are repeat calls between the same people, that’s a lot of people — including non-prisoners whose privacy has been compromised by a private company that is acting as an agent of the government,” he said.

Update: November 12, 2015

After this story was published, Securus emailed the following statement:

Securus is contacting law enforcement agencies in the investigation into media reports that inmate call records were leaked online. Although this investigation is ongoing, we have seen no evidence that records were shared as a result of a technology breach or hack into our systems. Instead, at this preliminary stage, evidence suggests that an individual or individuals with authorized access to a limited set of records may have used that access to inappropriately share those records.

We will fully support law enforcement in prosecution of any individuals found to have illegally shared information in this case. Data security is critically important to the law enforcement and criminal justice organizations that we serve, and we implement extensive measures to help ensure that all data is protected from both digital and physical breaches.

It is very important to note that we have found absolutely no evidence of attorney-client calls that were recorded without the knowledge and consent of those parties. Our calling systems include multiple safeguards to prevent this from occurring. Attorneys are able to register their numbers to exempt them from the recording that is standard for other inmate calls. Those attorneys who did not register their numbers would also hear a warning about recording prior to the beginning of each call, requiring active acceptance.

We are coordinating with law enforcement and we will provide updates as this investigation progresses.","telecoms","2",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

(Reuters) - Experian Plc (EXPN.L), the world’s biggest consumer credit monitoring firm, on Thursday disclosed a massive data breach that exposed sensitive personal data of some 15 million people who applied for service with T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N.

People pass by a T-Mobile store in the Brooklyn borough of New York June 4, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid
Connecticut’s attorney general said he will launch an investigation into the breach.

Experian said it discovered the theft of the T-Mobile customer data from one of its servers on Sept. 15. The computer stored information about some 15 million people who had applied for service with telecoms carrier T-Mobile during the prior two years, Experian said.

T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said the data included names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers and passport numbers. Such information is coveted by criminals for use in identity theft and other types of fraud.

""Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian,"" T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said in a note to customers posted on the company's website. ""But right now my top concern and first focus is assisting any and all consumers affected."" (t-mo.co/1M4FSSd)

The Experian breach is the latest in a string of massive hacks that have each claimed millions - and sometimes tens of millions - of customer records, including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. government this year, a 2014 breach on JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and a 2013 attack on Target Corp’s (TGT.N) cash register systems.

It is also the second massive breach linked to Experian. An attack on an Experian subsidiary that began before Experian purchased it in 2012 exposed the Social Security numbers of 200 million Americans and prompted an investigation by at least four states, including Connecticut.

Experian on Thursday said it had launched an investigation into the new breach and consulted with law enforcement.

The company offered two years of credit monitoring to all affected individuals. People, however, said that they did not want credit protection from a company that had been breached.

Legere responded by promising to seek alternatives.

“I hear you,” he said on Twitter. “I am moving as fast as possible to get an alternate option in place by tomorrow.”

Experian said the breach did not affect its vast consumer credit database.

Legere said no payment card or banking information was taken.

T-Mobile had nearly 59 million customers as of June 30. A representative for the carrier said that not all 15 million of the affected applicants had opened accounts with T-Mobile.

The telecom carrier’s shares were down 1.3 percent in extended trading after closing little changed at $40.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.

In the earlier data breach affecting Experian, a Vietnamese national confessed in U.S. court last year to using a false identity to opening an account with the unit, known as Court Ventures, sometime before Experian purchased it in 2012.

A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said on Thursday that it would investigate the latest attack.

The spokeswoman, Jaclyn Falkowski, declined to elaborate on the T-Mobile incident, but said the investigations of the Court Ventures matter “is active and ongoing.”

(In 7th and 16th paragraphs, this version of the story corrects to show that the previous Experian data breach began before Experian purchased the company in 2012, not that it occurred in 2014.)

Slack,  the super-slick team chat-room service, is getting popular fast. Word around the rumor mill is that it’s currently raising funds at a $2.8 billion valuation. And in the words of the late, great Biggie Smalls: Mo Money, Mo Problems. In the case of startups, success can make your databases a juicy target for hackers.

The bad news: Slack got hacked. Sometime in February, hackers were able to peruse Slack’s central database for up to four days.

The good news: The company patched the holes buffed up its available security features.

In a blog post on the topic, Slack’s head of Policy/Compliance Anne Toth detailed the intrusion.

Here’s how it breaks down:

Hackers were able to get into Slack’s central user database
This database included usernames, email addresses, encrypted passwords, and any user-profile stuff people chose to add to their account (phone numbers, Skype IDs, etc.)
Going a step further than normal, Slack described how their passwords were encrypted. They used a one-way hash function called bcrypt. There’s some discussion going on over at HackerNews as to whether or not this is sufficient.
Either way, you should follow standard procedure here. Change your Slack password just to be safe, and change it anywhere else you use the same password.
On the upside, Slack says no financial data was exposed. Unlike every other hack from the past few months, you shouldn’t need a new credit card this time.

In response to the hack, Slack has fired up two new security features: two factor authentication, and a team-wide password kill switch.

Everyone should be familiar with (and use!) two-factor at this point, but in case you’re not: the idea is that even if someone knows your password, they need physical access to something else (generally your cell phone) to sneak into your account. A randomly generated second password is sent to your phone. Without that, they’re locked out.

The password kill switch, meanwhile, allows for team administrators to boot everyone out of the Slack room and force them to reset their passwords. Now, that should be used sparingly because it’s inconvenient as hell and overuse will result in users making garbage passwords — but it’s handy when you suspect that someone is snooping but you’re not quite sure who/how.

And for those worried about prying eyes: Slack says that, at a wide scale, they believe “there was no unauthorized access to any of your team data (such as messages or files)” — and if they find any evidence that a specific team/room/person was compromised, they’ll contact them directly.

Information Commissioner’s Office making enquiries into data breach that also affected TalkTalk and iD users and exposed 90,000 customer credit cards

The UK’s data protection watchdog is investigating the hacking of Carphone Warehouse, which compromised the personal data and bank details of 2.4 million customers.

Carphone Warehouse said names, addresses, date of birth information and bank details of 2.4 million customers – and 90,000 customer credit cards – “may also have been accessed” in an attack on Wednesday.

Beyond brick and mortar stores selling mobile phones, plans and accessories the company also operates OneStopPhoneShop.co.uk, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk, while providing services to TalkTalk Mobile, Talk Mobile and its own recently launched iD mobile network

An Ico spokesman said: “We have been made aware of this incident at the Carphone Warehouse and are making enquiries.”

Carphone Warehouse informed Ico of the breach late last week and Scotland Yard on Sunday. The police said Sunday that it has yet to receive a formal report of a criminal offence, while the National Crime Agency would not confirm whether it was to open an investigation.

Carphone Warehouse, now part of Dixons Carphone following last year’s £3.7bn merger, began alerting customers via email on Saturday and took down affected websites.

Around 480,000 of the 2.4 million customers affected by the breach are TalkTalk Mobile customers and 1.9m were customers of Carphone Warehouse directly.

Security experts are urging customers affected by the breach to change their passwords and make sure that they are not used for other services such as email addresses or online banking.

“Carphone Warehouse is said to be getting in touch with customers who need to notify their bank and credit card company, but don’t be fooled by emails or phone calls pretending to be them,” warned Tony Neate, chief executive of Government-backed web security initiative Get Safe Online. “There will always be more cyber criminals looking to exploit the situation and trick you into sharing information a legitimate company would never ask for.”

An Ico spokesman added: “Any time personal data is lost there can be a risk of identity theft. There are measures you can take to guard against identity theft, for instance being vigilant around items on your credit card statements or checking your credit ratings.”

Airline says no personal information viewed or stolen and it has frozen affected accounts while it resolves issue

Hackers have accessed tens of thousands of British Airways frequent-flyer accounts.

The airline said no personal information had been viewed or stolen and it had frozen affected accounts while it resolves the issue. It means top executive club flyers may not be able to use their points until the issue is resolved.

The airline said only a small proportion of its millions of customers were affected, and no names, addresses, bank details or other personal information had been accessed. BA apologised to customers and said it expected to have the system back up and running in the next day or so.

It is not known who was behind the hack, but it is believed to have been carried out by an automated computer program looking for vulnerabilities in the company’s online security systems.


A BA spokesman said: “British Airways has become aware of some unauthorised activity in relation to a small number of frequent-flyer executive club accounts. This appears to have been the result of a third party using information obtained elsewhere on the internet, via an automated process, to try to gain access to some accounts.

“We would like to reassure customers that at this stage we are not aware of any access to any subsequent information pages within accounts, including travel histories or payment-card details.

“We are sorry for the concern and inconvenience this matter has caused and would like to reassure customers that we are taking this incident seriously and have taken a number of steps to lock down accounts so they can no longer be accessed.”

Anthem, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, said late Wednesday that the personal information of tens of millions of its customers and employees, including its chief executive, was the subject of a “very sophisticated external cyberattack.”

The company, which is continuing its investigation into the exact scope of the attack, said hackers were able to breach a database that contained as many as 80 million records of current and former customers, as well as employees. The information accessed included names, Social Security numbers, birthdays, addresses, email and employment information, including income data.

Anthem said no credit card information had been stolen, and it emphasized that it did not believe medical information like insurance claims or test results were compromised. It said hospital and doctor information was also not believed to have been taken.

Still, the attack, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, could be the largest breach of a health care company to date, and one of the largest ever of customer information.

Anthem said that the breach was detected on Jan. 29, and that the company was now working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The company said it had also hired Mandiant, a well-known cybersecurity firm, to look into vulnerabilities of its computer system.

In a letter to the company’s members, Joseph R. Swedish, Anthem’s chief executive, said he wanted “to personally apologize” for the security breach. He said his own personal information had been accessed and emphasized that the company was “working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data.”

Anthem operates health plans under numerous brands, including Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

The company said it would begin notifying members in the coming weeks. In a statement, the F.B.I. said that it was investigating the breach, and that people should alert officials to any possible instances of identity theft.

Anthem set up a website, www.AnthemFacts.com, and a toll-free number, 1-877-263-7995, to respond to any questions. The company said it would provide free identity repair services and credit monitoring.

The last year has seen an increasing number of sophisticated and ever larger hacks on corporate networks and even on federal government social media accounts.

In December, Staples, the office supply retailer, said hackers had broken into the company’s network and compromised the information of about 1.16 million credit cards when they broke into the company’s network in October.

JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, last summer said hackers had compromised some of the personal information of 83 million households and small businesses. But the bank has said that the attack was limited to nonfinancial information such as customer addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.

And in November, hackers that the United States government has said had ties to the North Korean government orchestrated a destructive attack on Sony Entertainment that resulted in a flood of confidential executive emails and personal information about employees and the company’s plans for coming movies.

Federal authorities believe the attack was in response to Sony’s plans to release the movie “The Interview,” a comedy about fictional plot to kill the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

The ever increasing threat of cyberattacks on United States companies, whether carried out by cybercriminals looking to steal information to make money or nation-state actors looking to send a message, has become a top priority for federal law enforcement.

The F.B.I. now ranks cybercrime as one of its top law enforcement activities, and President Obama’s recently proposed budget advocates sharply increasing spending on cybersecurity, to $14 billion.

Social Security numbers are a particularly popular target for hackers. Combinations of Social Security numbers, birth dates and names sell for more than even credit card numbers in an increasingly sophisticated black market, where such information is sold and resold through popular auction sites.

Law enforcement officials have openly said that keeping ahead of the hackers — many of whom are believed to live overseas — is a challenge. On Wednesday, Leo Taddeo, the F.B.I. agent in New York who oversees the cyber and special operations division, said at a financial services industry conference in New York that “we are losing ground” in the battle with hackers.

Other in law enforcement have said it is no longer a matter whether a company will be hacked but when it will be hacked.

The threat of a hacking is particularly acute in the health care and financial services industry, where companies routinely keep the most sensitive personal information about their customers on large databases.

“We have seen a huge uptick in health care hacks,” said Vitor De Souza, vice president of communications for FireEye, the parent company of Mandiant.

Anthem learned of the hacking last week and called in Mandiant over the weekend. The company was not obligated to report the breach for at least several more weeks but chose to do so now to show that it was treating the matter seriously.

The F.B.I. praised Anthem for quickly alerting the authorities. “Anthem’s initial response in promptly notifying the F.B.I. after observing suspicious network activity is a model for other companies and organizations facing similar circumstances,” said Joshua Campbell, an F.B.I. spokesman, in an email statement.

LinkedIn was hacked four years ago, and what initially seemed to be a theft of 6.5 million passwords has actually turned out to be a breach of 117 million passwords.
On Wednesday, the professional social network company acknowledged that a massive batch of login credentials is being sold on the black market by hackers.

The worst part about it is that, because people tend to reuse their passwords, hackers are more likely to gain access to 117 million people's email and bank accounts.

The advice for everyone who uses LinkedIn (LNKD) at this point is: Change your password and add something called two-factor authentication, which requires a text message every time you sign in from a new computer.

This episode drudges up some embarrassing history for LinkedIn.

Because of the company's old security policy, these passwords are easy for hackers to crack in a matter of days.

Companies typically protect customer passwords by encrypting them. But at the time of the 2012 data breach, LinkedIn hadn't added a pivotal layer of security that makes the jumbled text harder to decode.

Put on the defensive, LinkedIn is now scrambling to try to stop people from sharing the stolen goods online -- often an impractical task. The company is also invalidating all customer passwords that haven't been updated since they were stolen.

LinkedIn said it's reaching out to individual members affected by the breach. This particular hack affects a quarter of the company's 433 million members.

Now, computer security experts are wondering why it took so long for LinkedIn to figure out what happened to their own company computers -- or acknowledge it publicly.

""If LinkedIn is only now discovering the scale of data that was exfiltrated from their systems, what went wrong with the forensic analysis that should have discovered this?"" said Brad Taylor, CEO of cybersecurity firm Proficio.

Hackers are selling the stolen LinkedIn database on a black market online called ""The Real Deal,"" according to tech news site Motherboard.

"192","Tumblr","65,000,000","2016","Hackers Stole 65 Million Passwords From Tumblr, New Analysis Reveals

Two weeks after Tumblr disclosed a 2013 data breach, we finally know how big it was.

On May 12, Tumblr revealed that it had just found out about a 2013 data breach affecting ""a set"" of users' email addresses and passwords, but the company refused to reveal how many users were affected.

As it turns out, that number is 65 million, according to an independent analysis of the data.

Troy Hunt, a security researcher who maintains the data breach awareness portal Have I Been Pwned, recently obtained a copy of the stolen data set.

Hunt told Motherboard that the data contained 65,469,298 unique emails and passwords. (Tumblr did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the figure).

The passwords, however, were not in plaintext, but were ""hashed,"" a process that turns the actual password into a different string of digits. The company also added a series of random bytes at the end of the passwords before hashing them, or ""salted"" them, as Tumblr said when it disclosed the breach. The company, however, didn't say exactly what algorithm it used to hash the passwords.

Since Tumblr's announcement, the hacked data appears to have been circulating within the internet underground. A hacker known as Peace, who also claims to have the data and was selling it on the darknet marketplace The Real Deal, said Tumblr used SHA1 to hash the passwords. Given that it also used salt, they are very hard for hackers to crack.

That's why, Peace told me, the data was essentially just a list of emails, and he was only able to sell it for $150.

In any case, considering the age of the breach and the bad practices that were used at the time across websites, it's fair to assume half of the passwords could be cracked, according to Hunt.

This data breach is now listed on Have I Been Pwned as the third largest ever, after the hack of 164 million LinkedIn accounts and the breach of 152 million Adobe accounts. You can check there to find out if you were a victim, though you should've been notified by Tumblr when the company forced users to reset passwords after announcing the breach.

What's interesting about this incident is that it's come along with other massive data breaches that were just recently disclosed, but date back a few years.

""This data is lying dormant (or at least out of public sight) for long periods of time,"" Hunt wrote in a blog post on Monday.

Since Tumblr's data was discovered, years-old breaches at LinkedIn and MySpace have also emerged in the last couple of weeks. Whether there will be more, it's anyone's guess. But as we're slowly learning, everyone gets hacked, though sometimes we don't find out for years.

""If this indeed is a trend, where does it end? What more is in store that we haven't already seen?"" Hunt wrote. ""And for that matter, even if these events don't all correlate to the same source and we're merely looking at coincidental timing of releases, how many more are there in the 'mega' [breach] category that are simply sitting there in the clutches of various unknown parties?""

Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell companies enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.

In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.

The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes.

A group effort
The Süddeutsche Zeitung decided to analyze the data in cooperation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). ICIJ had already coordinated the research for past projects that SZ was also involved in, among them Offshore Leaks, Lux Leaks, and Swiss Leaks. Panama Papers is the biggest-ever international cooperation of its kind. In the past 12 months, around 400 journalists from more than 100 media organizations in over 80 countries have taken part in researching the documents. These have included teams from the Guardian and the BBC in England, Le Monde in France, and La Nación in Argentina. In Germany, SZ journalists have cooperated with their colleagues from two public broadcasters, NDR and WDR. Journalists from the Swiss Sonntagszeitung and the Austrian weekly Falter have also worked on the project, as have their colleagues at ORF, Austria’s national public broadcaster. The international team initially met in Washington, Munich, Lillehammer and London to map out the research approach.

The data
The Panama Papers include approximately 11.5 million documents – more than the combined total of the Wikileaks Cablegate, Offshore Leaks, Lux Leaks, and Swiss Leaks. The data primarily comprises e-mails, pdf files, photo files, and excerpts of an internal Mossack Fonseca database. It covers a period spanning from the 1970s to the spring of 2016. 

Moreover, the journalists crosschecked a large number of documents, including passport copies. About two years ago, a whistleblower had already sold internal Mossack Fonseca data to the German authorities, but the dataset was much older and smaller in scope: while it addressed a few hundred offshore companies, the Panama Papers provide data on some 214,000 companies. In the wake of the data purchase, last year investigators searched the homes and offices of about 100 people. The Commerzbank was also raided. As a consequence of their business dealings with Mossack Fonseca, Commerzbank, HSH Nordbank, and Hypovereinsbank agreed to pay fines of around 20 million euros, respectively. Since then, other countries have also acquired data from the initial smaller leak, among them the United States, the UK, and Iceland.

The system
The leaked data is structured as follows: Mossack Fonseca created a folder for each shell firm. Each folder contains e-mails, contracts, transcripts, and scanned documents. In some instances, there are several thousand pages of documentation. First, the data had to be systematically indexed to make searching through this sea of information possible. To this end, the Süddeutsche Zeitung used Nuix, the same program that international investigators work with. Süddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ uploaded millions of documents onto high-performance computers. They applied optical character recognition (OCR) to transform data into machine-readable and easy to search files. The process turned images – such as scanned IDs and signed contracts – into searchable text. This was an important step: it enabled journalists to comb through as large a portion of the leak as possible using a simple search mask similar to Google.
The journalists compiled lists of important politicians, international criminals, and well-known professional athletes, among others. The digital processing made it possible to then search the leak for the names on these lists. The ""party donations scandal"" list contained 130 names, and the UN sanctions list more than 600. In just a few minutes, the powerful search algorithm compared the lists with the 11.5 million documents.

The research
For each name found, a detailed research process was initiated that posed the following questions: what is this person’s role in the network of companies? Where does the money come from? Where is it going? Is this structure legal?
Generally speaking, owning an offshore company is not illegal in itself. In fact, establishing an offshore company can be seen as a logical step for a broad range of business transactions. However, a look through the Panama Papers very quickly reveals that concealing the identities of the true company owners was the primary aim in the vast majority of cases. From the outset, the journalists had their work cut out for them. The providers of offshore companies – among them banks, lawyers, and investment advisors – often keep their clients’ names secret and use proxies. In turn, the proxies’ tracks then lead to heads of state, important officials, and millionaires. Over the course of the international project, journalists cooperated with one another to investigate thousands of leads: they examined evidence, studied contracts, and spoke with experts.

Among others, Mossack Fonsecas’ clients include criminals and members of various Mafia groups. The documents also expose bribery scandals and corrupt heads of state and government. The alleged offshore companies of twelve current and former heads of state make up one of the most spectacular parts of the leak, as do the links to other leaders, and to their families, closest advisors, and friends. The Panamanian law firm also counts almost 200 other politicians from around the globe among its clients, including a number of ministers.

The company
The company at the center of all these stories is Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian provider of offshore companies with dozens of offices all over the world. It sells its shell firms in cities such as Zurich, London, and Hong Kong – in some instances at bargain prices. Clients can buy an anonymous company for as little as USD 1,000. However, at this price it is just an empty shell. For an extra fee, Mossack Fonseca provides a sham director and, if desired, conceals the company’s true shareholder. The result is an offshore company whose true purpose and ownership structure is indecipherable from the outside. Mossack Fonseca has founded, sold, and managed thousands of companies. The documents provide a detailed view of how Mossack Fonseca routinely accepts to engage in business activities that potentially violate sanctions, in addition to aiding and abetting tax evasion and money laundering.

"195","Philippines’ Commission on Elections","55,000,000","2016","Data Protection Mishap Leaves 55M Philippine Voters at Risk
Every registered voter in the Philippines is now susceptible to fraud and other risks after a massive data breach leaked the entire database of the Philippines’ Commission on Elections (COMELEC). While initial reports have downplayed the impact of the leak, our investigations showed a huge number of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII)–including passport information and fingerprint data–were included in the data dump.

Following the defacement of the COMELEC website on March 27 by a hacker group, a second hacker group posted COMELEC’s entire database online. Within the day, they added three more mirror links where the database could be downloaded. With 55 million registered voters in the Philippines, this leak may turn out as one of the biggest government-related data breaches in history, surpassing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) hack last 2015 that leaked PII, including fingerprints and social security numbers (SSN) of 20 million US citizens.

 

Election Tension

With the upcoming Philippine national elections on May 9, the incident puts further pressure on the COMELEC and their Automated Voting System (AVS). The first hacker group gave a stern warning for COMELEC to implement the security features of the vote counting machines. However, the actions done by the second hacker group have exposed COMELEC’s weaknesses in terms of network and data security.

In a statement, COMELEC spokesperson James Jimenez admits that the security of the website is not high. However, he pointed out that the AVS ran on a different, more secure network and that the recent hack will not affect the machines. Jimenez is confident of the security features of the AVS and reassures involved publics that things will go smoothly during the elections.

There are however discrepancies in the statements made and our findings. COMELEC officials claimed that there were no sensitive information stored in the database. However, our research showed that massive records of PII, including fingerprints data were leaked. Included in the data COMELEC deemed public was a list of COMELEC officials that have admin accounts.

 

“VOTESOBTAINED”

Based on our investigation, the data dumps include 1.3 million records of overseas Filipino voters, which included passport numbers and expiry dates. What is alarming is that this crucial data is just in plain text and accessible to everyone.  Interestingly, we also found a whopping 15.8 million record of fingerprints and a list of people running for office since the 2010 elections.

In addition, among the data leaked were files on all candidates running on the election with the filename VOTESOBTAINED. Based on the filename, it reflects the number of votes obtained by the candidate. Currently, all VOTESOBTAINED file are set to have NULL as figure.

The COMELEC website also shows real time ballot count during the actual elections. While COMELEC claims that this function will be done using a different website, we can only speculate if actual data will be placed here during the elections and if tampering with the data would affect the ballot count.

 

Every registered citizen at risk

Regardless whether the hacking could affect the elections, there is still the issue of all voter information that was leaked. Reports stated that while some of the data were encrypted, there were some fields that were left wide open.

Cybercriminals can choose from a wide range of activities to use the information gathered from the data breach to perform acts of extortion. In previous cases of data breach, stolen data has been used to access bank accounts, gather further information about specific persons, used as leverage for spear phishing emails or BEC schemes, blackmail or extortion, and much more.

 

Data Classification and defending against data breaches

Data breach incidents make daily headlines and affects businesses (whether enterprises or small and medium-sized businesses) from various industries and large organizations.  According to our research paper, Follow the Data: Dissecting Data Breaches and Debunking Myths government agencies are the third biggest sector affected by data breach, followed by retail and financial industries. Healthcare and education are the top and second-most affected industries, respectively.

The recent security incidents highlighted the need for stronger security mindset and data classification, given the possible impact of the breach to voters. This also brings to the fore the importance of having data protection officers that would be responsible for the legal requirements as well as securing all types of crown jewels or highly sensitive data of organizations.

“It will be crucial for companies to employ Data Protection Officers, but even then it will be an uphill battle for various reasons, including cultural differences. For example, In Germany, having a Data Protection Officers is necessary by law, but in other countries, it’s not. Companies might even think that they don’t need one,” shares Raimund Genes, Chief Technology Officer for Trend Micro.

Organizations and companies take a heavy hit with each case of data breach, but those who are truly at risk are the owners of the stolen data. As such, instilling a security mindset should be essential when dealing with important data. In the case of COMELEC, companies and organizations should practice data classification. Data classification is done to segregate data of varying sensitivity and applying appropriate protection to each category:

High Sensitivity – Data such as voter database falls under high sensitivity data, which are confidential and restricted. High sensitivity data, when stolen, may cause damage or harm to one or more individuals.
Medium Sensitivity – this data is usually for internal public only. The COMELEC leak does not appear to have leaked medium sensitivity data, but examples of which include company emails and documents.
Low Sensitivity – these data are usually made public and unrestricted. In the leak, low sensitivity data includes the candidate list and their information. Loss of this data type is not considered critical.
After classifying the data, the next step is to defend them. Methods vary depending on the data, how it’s stored, and who can access it. Sensitive data needs to be stored in a separate or disconnected network and needs higher security clearance to be accessed.
Here are other ways to prevent and defend against data breaches:

Patching systems and network accordingly – regular patching and updating of systems can prevent cybercriminals from exploiting vulnerabilities which can open the doors to your networks.
Educate and enforce – employees must be trained to respond to threats, know social engineering tactics, and know how to enforce guidelines on how to handle specific situations.
Implement security measures – create processes that can identify and address network threats. Regularly conduct security audits to make sure all systems connected to the network are secured.
Create contingencies – in case of a data breach, an appropriate response plan must be put into action. This is to minimize confusion by being ready with persons to contact, steps to mitigate the damage, and strategies to disclose the incident to relevant publics.
End point solutions such as Trend Micro™ Security,  Smart Protection Suites, and Worry-Free™ Business Security can protect companies and organizations by detecting malicious files that are used as infiltration methods during data breaches. We also secure enterprises via our Trend Micro Network Defense and Hybrid Cloud Security solutions, which detect and prevent breaches anywhere on your network to protect an organization’s critical data and reputation.

"196","Syrian government","274,477","2016","Syrian Government Hacked, 43 GB of Data Spilled Online by Hacktivists

Cyber Justice Team hackers leak Syrian government data.

On April 6, a hacking outfit going by the name of Cyber Justice Team leaked 10 GB of compressed data from multiple Syrian government and private websites.

The hackers uploaded the files on the MEGA file hosting service, which when decompressed yielded over 43 GB of data. The announcement was also accompanied by a PasteBin which included the password file from a breached Linux server belonging to the Syrian National Agency for Network Services, the country's regulatory commission for IT services.

Most of the leaked data seems to be from older attacks
Analysts from Risk Based Security (RBS) examined the data dump, which they say contained 38,768 folders with 274,477 files from 55 different website domains, belonging to both national agencies and private companies. The data contained database dumps, and even server passwords.

Of the 55 domains, 25 were government websites (.gov.sy), two .org.sy domains, one .com.sy, and the rest were regular .sy domains.

""The first pass at reviewing the data sparked a sense of some more deja vu, as many of the files appeared to include domains from previous, smaller defacements and leaks,"" RBS wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""Further analysis confirmed our initial suspicions.""

A closer look at the stolen files revealed that most of them were generic Plesk (Web hosting panel) files, or from Joomla and Cportal (PHP-Nuke-based portal) installations.

It is worth mentioning that both Cportal and PHP-Nuke, its underlying technology, are extremely outdated, haven't received any recent updates, and are known for having security vulnerabilities. This confirms that the data may be from older hacks, when Cportal was still a popular CMS platform, especially in the government sector.

Cyber Justice Team is anti-ISIS, anti-Assad
In statements made on Twitter, the Cyber Justice Team took a stance against ISIS and the Assad regime, calling them both ""killers of the Syrian people.""

In the past week, two massive data breaches were released online by hacktivists. First, an unknown group released details of about 50 million Turkish citizens, then Anonymous Philippines and LulzSec Philippines lead the details of 55 million of their fellow nationals.

A list of all domains included in the data breach is available on the RBS website.

"197","Minecraft","7,000,000","2016","Another Day, Another Hack: 7 Million Accounts for Minecraft Community ‘Lifeboat’

Security researcher Troy Hunt obtained data containing email addresses and passwords hashed with the weak MD5 algorithm.

Quite literally, every day someone gets hacked. Whether that's a telecommunications company having its customer data stolen, or another chain of businesses being ripped for all the credit cards it processes, today one hack just seems to melt into another.

In our series Another Day, Another Hack, we do short posts giving you what you need to know about the hack, so you can figure out whether your bank account, website logins or anything else might be at risk. Because, even if the hack might not be the most sophisticated, real people are still getting fucked over somewhere, and should know about it.

Over seven million user accounts belonging to members of Minecraft community ""Lifeboat"" have been hacked, according to security researcher Troy Hunt.

Hunt said he will upload the data to his breach notification website ""Have I Been Pwned?"", which allows people to check if their account is compromised, on Tuesday, and that it includes email addresses and weakly hashed passwords—meaning that hackers could likely obtain full passwords from some of the data.

""The data was provided to me by someone actively involved in trading who's sent me other data in the past,"" Hunt, who has verified the data and sent Motherboard a redacted screenshot of some of it, said in an email.

Lifeboat runs servers for custom, multiplayer environments of Minecraft Pocket Edition—the smartphone version of the game—which allow Minecraft players to participate in different game modes, such as capture the flag or survival. To join the community, players download the normal Pocket Edition app, connect to a Lifeboat server, and register a username with an email address and password.

Hunt put Motherboard in touch with several victims of the breach, who said they had not been informed by Lifeboat of the hack.

""No lifeboat has not notified me of anything. Looks like they want to keep it [quiet], which I guess isn't that fair,"" one user called Tyler, who said he was from Airdrie, Canada, told Motherboard in an email.

""They either didn't even notice yet or just don't care,"" said a player named Henni.

""It's bad that they were breached in the first place, but not telling us about it is even worse,"" Ali, who said they were from Wisconsin, added.

Lifeboat said it had been aware of the breach for some time.

""When this happened [in] early January we figured the best thing for our players was to quietly force a password reset without letting the hackers know they had limited time to act,"" a Lifeboat representative said in an email. ""We did this over a period of some weeks. We retain no personal information (name, address, age) about our players, so none was leaked.""

""We have not received any reports of anyone being damaged by this,"" the representative added in another email. They did not reply when asked to clarify why the company did not inform users. The three players Motherboard spoke to said they had not received a password reset.

Although the passwords in the breach were hashed, they were done so with the notoriously weak MD5 algorithm, meaning that plenty of the passwords could be figured out with the use of online tools.

""I was able to easily verify people's passwords with them simply by Googling them, such is the joy of unsalted MD5,"" Hunt said. Motherboard confirmed that one of the hashes provided by Hunt corresponded to an easily guessable password. The Lifeboat representative said that the company now uses a stronger hashing algorithm.

Naturally, if victims have used the same passwords on other services, such as their email, anyone in possession of the data has a chance of accessing those accounts too.

Lifeboat's approach to security appears to be demonstrated in a how-to guide on its website. ""By the way, we recommend short, but difficult to guess passwords. This is not online banking,"" it reads.

The lesson: If you care about the security of your accounts, you should really be using strong, unique passwords for each. That way, when a breach occurs on one service—and they will clearly happen—hackers will only be able to access that specific account.","tech","1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

Phoenix-based Banner Health, one of the largest healthcare systems in the U.S., announced on August 3 that it is notifying approximately 3.7 million individuals about a breach in which cyber attackers gained unauthorized access to computer systems that process payment card data at food and beverage outlets at certain Banner locations.

The incident was discovered by Banner Health on July 7, though the attack was initiated on June 17, according to the health system’s press release. The attackers targeted payment card data, including cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code, as the data was being routed through affected payment processing systems. Payment cards used at food and beverage outlets at certain Banner Health locations during the two-week period between June 23 and July 7 may have been affected. The investigation revealed that the attack did not affect payment card payments used to pay for medical services, the organization said.

Then, on July 13, Banner Health learned that the cyber attackers may have indeed gained unauthorized access to patient information, health plan member and beneficiary information, as well as information about physician and healthcare providers. The patient and health plan information may have included names, birthdates, addresses, physicians’ names, dates of service, claims information, and possibly health insurance information and social security numbers, if provided to Banner Health. The physician and provider information may have included names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers and other identifiers they may use.

How the hack expanded from certain food and beverage outlets to patient information systems is currently unclear. But, Banner has mailed letters to 3.7 million patients, health plan members and beneficiaries, food and beverage customers and physicians and healthcare providers related to  the attack.

The health system said that it “worked quickly to block the attackers and is working to enhance the security of its systems in order to help prevent this from happening in the future.” Banner is also working with the payment card networks so banks that issue payment cards can be made aware and initiate heightened monitoring on the affected cards.

Banner Health is offering a free one-year membership in monitoring services to patients, health plan members, health plan beneficiaries, physicians and healthcare providers, and food and beverage customers who were affected by this incident.

The health system owns and operates 29 acute care hospitals, Banner Health Network, Banner University Medicine, Banner Medical Group, long-term care centers, outpatient surgery centers and an array of other services, including family clinics, home care and hospice services, pharmacies and a nursing registry. Banner Health is spread throughout seven states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada and Wyoming

“Banner is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of information of our patients, employees, plan members and beneficiaries, customers at our food and beverage outlets, as well as our providers,” Peter S. Fine, Banner Health president and CEO, said in a statement.

Over 25 million accounts associated with forums hosted by Russian internet giant Mail.ru have been stolen by hackers.

Two hackers carried out attacks on three separate game-related forums in July and August. One forum alone accounted for almost half of the breached data -- a little under 13 million records; the other two forums make up over 12 million records.

The databases were stolen in early August, according to breach notification site LeakedSource.com, which obtained a copy of the databases.

The hackers' names aren't known, but they used known SQL injection vulnerabilities found in older vBulletin forum software to get access to the databases.

An analysis of the breached data showed that hackers took 12.8 million accounts from cfire.mail.ru; a total of 8.9 million records from parapa.mail.ru, and 3.2 million accounts from tanks.mail.ru.

The hackers were able to obtain usernames, email addresses, scrambled passwords, and birthdays. Some of the forums allowed the hackers to also obtain IP addresses (which could be used to determine location) and phone numbers.

A member of the LeakedSource group told me that about half of the passwords -- around 12 million -- were easily cracked using readily available cracking tools. That's because, according to the group's blog post, the sites ""all used some variation of MD5 with or without unique salts"", an algorithm that is considered insecure by today's standards.

The group said that the most common four passwords were some combination of ""123456789"", which in part made it easier to determine a significant portion of the leaked passwords.

The breach notification confirmed that it has added the breached data into its database, alongside another 2.3 million records from 10 other websites that the group bundled in with its blog post.

This is the latest hack in a long line of similar attacks on out-of-date and unpatched forums with widely known and glaring security flaws. Many of Mail.ru's forums ran versions of vBulletin software dating back to early-2013.

It's also not the first time that Mail.ru has suffered a breach this year. In June, the company -- which also owns Russian social network VK.com -- confirmed that it was also breached, albeit some years earlier when the site's security was far more primitive.

In an emailed statement, Mail.ru spokesperson Nataliya Bogdanovich played down the attacks.

""They are old passwords to the forums of game projects that Mail.ru Group acquired over the years. All Mail.ru Group's forums and games have been using a secure integrated authorization system for a long time by now,"" said the spokesperson.

Ahuge cache of personal data from Dropbox that contains the usernames and passwords of nearly 70 million account holders has been discovered online. 

The information, believed to have been stolen in a hack that occurred several years ago, includes the passwords and email addresses of 68.7 million users of the cloud storage service.

Dropbox confirmed that the credentials were stolen in a hack that occurred in 2012 when hackers used stolen employee login details to access a document containing the email address and passwords of users. The number of users affected by the hack was not known until now, and the company had previously said only email addresses were taken - not passwords. 

""This is not a new security incident, and there is no indication that Dropbox user accounts have been improperly accessed,"" said Patrick Heim, the head of trust and security at Dropbox. 

The company discovered the details for sale online when it was conducting routine security work. Motherboard then revealed the exact number of affected users after Leakbase, a breach notification service, provided it with the full set of data. 

Dropbox, which has around 500 million registered users, is the fourth major company this year to have found user credentials stolen in a 2012 hack circulating online. MySpace and LinkedIn both confirmed in May that hundreds of millions their users' of passwords and email addresses stolen in 2012 hacks were for sale online.

Earlier this month Yahoo said it was investigating reports that 200 million of its users accounts were up for sale, allegedly taken in a hack that was previously unreported. 

Does the hack affect me?
In response to the discovery, Dropbox has prompted users who may have been affected by the hack to reset their passwords.

This includes anyone who signed up to Dropbox before the middle of 2012 and has not changed their password since then.

How to protect yourself 
If you think you may have been affected by the breach, login to your Dropbox account and see if it prompts you to update your details. 

As Dropbox had taken measures to ensure that its users' passwords were kept securely, the chances of them being in the hands of hackers is slim. The company had ""hashed"" and
""salted"" the details, which means that they were scrambled and had a random string added to them that can only be deciphered using a cryptographic key.

To keep its users' passwords secure, the company has also updated the way it stores its passwords multiple times since 2012. 

""Even if these passwords are cracked, the password reset means they can't be used to access Dropbox accounts,"" said Heim.

If you think your current password was stolen, it could be used to access other accounts that you use the same login details for online.

To protect yourself from being hacked again, change your passwords and turn on two-step verification. Security experts advise people to never use the same password more than once and to use a string of letters and numbers that is difficult to guess. 

The breach also includes usernames, which hackers could use in spam and phishing attacks. Dropbox warned users who received its password reset notification to be extra-alert if they receive suspicious emails. 

Fake emails often contain tell-tale signs such as spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. If you're uncertain about the source of an email make sure you don't click on any links or provide the sender with any sensitive information. It is also advised that you don't call a phone number provided in a suspicious message. 

To shore up your safety online, when you receive an email asking you to check your account manually type the company's website into your browser rather than clicking on a link, which could take you to a fake version of the site.

PayAsUGym alerted its members to the security breach in an email on Friday which said ""one of the company's IT servers was accessed by an unauthorised person"".

It went on: ""Although we do not hold any financial or credit card information, the unauthorised person could have accessed the e-mail address and password of our customers.

""Passwords are encrypted when saved in the database, nevertheless I would encourage you to change your password.""

'More frequent' attacks
Several customers' email addresses and passwords appear to have been published online.

PayAsUGym said once it was alerted, it ""closed down"" the breach and contacted the police.

It has also started using new servers after speaking with cybersecurity professionals.

The website uses a ""tokenised system"" for customer payments which, it says, means card details are stored at the payment gateway - not on its servers.

""This is the highest level of security process for dealing with payments,"" it said.

PayAsUGym added: ""We take the security of customer information very seriously. Unfortunately cyber attacks are becoming more frequent which is why, as a policy, we do not (and will never) hold financial or credit card details and we insist that all passwords are encrypted when stored.""","tech","1",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Network_Based_Attack"

The company that builds Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution, has said its forums were hacked Thursday.

Canonical, which develops the operating system, said in a statement on Friday that two million usernames, email addresses, and IP addresses associated with the Ubuntu Forums were taken by an unnamed attacker.

That gave the attacker access to the forum's databases, but the company said that only limited user data was accessed and downloaded.

The statement stressed that no code or repository data was accessed, and the attacker couldn't write data to the database or gain shell access. The attacker also didn't gain access to any other Canonical or Ubuntu service.

Since the breach, the servers were wiped, rebuilt, and hardened, passwords were changed, and the forum software was fully patched.

The statement added that although the forums relied on Ubuntu's single sign-on service, the passwords were hashed and salted, turning them into randomized strings of data. But the statement did not say which hashing algorithm was used -- some algorithms, like MD5, are still in use but are deprecated, as they can be easily cracked.

A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a question about the hashing algorithm. (We'll update if we hear back.)

It can't hurt to change your passwords to be safe, and to enable two-factor authentication.

The popular forum software has long been a target for hackers and attackers as an easy point of access to other systems. Most recently, as many as 45 million accounts from over a thousand car, tech, and sports forums owned by Canadian media giant VerticalScope were hacked after an attacker exploited known flaws in the software.

Some of the installations date back to 2007 and hadn't been updated since.

Counterfeit Credit Card Fraud Reaches Lowest Level Since 2013

The US credit card market's move to EMV chip technology has helped reverse a years-long trend of increasing counterfeit fraud, according to some new data. The share of financial losses stemming from counterfeit activity--which increased dramatically following a wave of high-profile data compromises in recent years--fell 18% in the first quarter of this year, reaching its lowest level since early 2013. Counterfeit fraud losses have declined steadily relative to other categories since the industry's EMV liability shift took effect late last year, and have decreased by nearly one-fourth since their peak in late 2014.

Supreme Court Asked to Weigh Florida Credit Card Surcharges

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a dispute about the constitutionality of a Florida law that has blocked businesses from imposing surcharges on customers who pay with credit cards. A divided 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the longstanding law is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment. The appeals court said Florida allows businesses to offer discounts to customers who pay with cash but does not allow surcharges for credit card purchases---a situation the majority opinion likened to ""distinctions in search of a difference.""

Uber Switches to Bitcoin in Argentina After Govt Blocks Uber Credit Cards

The Argentinian government blocked credit card companies from dealing with Uber, causing the ridesharing company's national branch to use Bitcoin instead. The city of Buenos Aires issued orders both to the national communications agency and credit card companies to block the Uber app and deny the company use of credit card service. This prompted Uber to partner with Swiss Bitcoin company Xapo to enable payments through Bitcoin debit cards. [The Coin Telegraph]

The Hispanic Boom Extends to Credit Cards

Keep a watch for more Visa and MasterCard commercials appearing in Spanish. The huge growth in the number of U.S. Hispanics also means an opportunity for financial services companies. Between 2005 and 2015, credit card use among Latinos increased 11 times faster than it did among non-Hispanics. Hispanic usage surged 44%, versus just 4% for the general market. During that period 5.1 million Hispanics began using credit cards. That accounted for 49% of the overall growth in the number of U.S. consumers using credit cards. [Media Life Magazine]

MasterCard Could be Facing a $24.6 Billion Lawsuit

U.K. consumers are preparing to a file a $24.6 billion suit against MasterCard over cross-border transaction fees that were deemed illegal in 2014. A European Commission hearing in 2014 revealed that MasterCard's cross-border interchange fees violated EU law. The lawsuit claims that the fees were so exorbitant that retailers increased their consumer prices in response. This forced consumers to over-spend on goods and services from 1992 to 2008, and the plaintiffs now believe they are owed losses as a result. The company vehemently disagrees with the fundamentals of the suit and states it does not earn any revenue from interchange. [Business Insider]

Americans Spent Gas Savings on Dining, Shopping...and More Gas

Falling oil prices saved Americans hundreds of dollars at the gas pump in 2015, and a lot of them spent those savings at the gas station. Middle-income households saved an average of $477 through the year, thanks to gas prices that fell 28% from 2014. The biggest business winners of the gas-price windfall were restaurants and retailers. A big chunk of the gasoline savings--a full $155--was spent right back at the gas station. Consumers bought more gas, higher-quality gas and snacks. [CNBC]

Bitcoin and Prepaid Cards Face Tighter Controls Under EU Proposals

The European Commission proposed expanding its anti-money-laundering rules to cover virtual currencies and prepaid cards, in a bid to fight terror financing and tax evasion as revealed in the Paris attacks and the Panama Papers disclosures. The proposals from the commission, the EU's executive arm, also seek to strengthen oversight of bank accounts and increase transparency about the ownership of trusts across the bloc. The perpetrators of the Nov. 13 Paris terror attacks used prepaid cards. Virtual-currency platforms, such as bitcoin, would be brought under anti-money-laundering rules that should come into effect by the end of this year.

By Mark Hosenball, Joseph Menn and John Walcott

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, July 29 (Reuters) - The computer network used by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The latest attack, which was disclosed to Reuters on Friday, follows reports of two other hacks on the Democratic National Committee and the party's fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives.

The U.S. Department of Justice national security division is investigating whether cyber hacking attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened U.S. security, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The involvement of the Justice Department's national security division is a sign that the Obama administration has concluded that the hacking was state sponsored, individuals with knowledge of the investigation said.

The Clinton campaign, based in Brooklyn, had no immediate comment and referred Reuters to a comment from earlier this week by campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan criticizing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and calling the hacking ""a national security issue.""

The Department of Justice had no comment.

It was not immediately clear what information on the Clinton campaign's computer system hackers would have been able to access.

Hackers, whom U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were Russian, gained access to the entire network of the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, of DCCC, said people familiar with the matter, detailing the extent of the breach to Reuters for the first time.

Access to the full DCCC network would have given the hackers access to everything from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support Democratic candidates in campaigns for the House.

The hack of the DCCC, which is based in Washington, was reported first by Reuters on Thursday, ahead of Clinton's speech in Philadelphia accepting the Democratic party's nomination. Russian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

The DCCC said in a statement early on Friday that it has hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate.

""We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,"" the DCCC said. ""We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.""

The hackers were able to get their hands on the user database, and a warning issued by the software maker says that passwords should be considered compromised.

utorrentforumsWith well over 150 million active users a month uTorrent is by far the most used BitTorrent client around.

In addition, the software also has a dedicated community forums with tens of thousands of visitors per day, and over 388,000 registered members.

According to a recent security alert these users would be to update their passwords, as the forum database has been compromised by hackers.

The uTorrent team, which is part of BitTorrent Inc, was alerted to the issue by one of their vendors earlier this week. While the vulnerability didn’t originate at the uTorrent forums, it was indirectly compromised.

“The vulnerability appears to have been through one of the vendor’s other clients, however it allowed attackers to access some information on other accounts. As a result, attackers were able to download a list of our forum users,” uTorrent writes.

The security alert is posted in the forums but as far as we know users haven’t been notified individually. There is no mention of the massive security breach on uTorrent and BitTorrent’s social media accounts either.

According to the uTorrent team it’s not entirely clear what data has been compromised by the hack. The company’s vendor has made some changes to mitigate the fallout, but the hashed passwords are likely compromised.

“We are investigating further to learn if any other information was accessed. Our vendor has made backend changes so that the hashes in the file do not appear to be a usable attack vector,” the uTorrent team writes.

“As a precaution, we are advising our users to change their passwords. While the passwords may not be used as a vector on the forums, those hashed passwords should be considered compromised,” they add.

In addition, users are strongly advised to update their passwords at other sites, if the ones they’re using are identical to the one deployed on the forum.

While uTorrent no longer reports the number of forum users, a few months ago it listed 388,358 members who together wrote over half a million posts.

The uTorrent forums use the Invision Power Board software. The same software also powers the separate BitTorrent forums, which given the lack of a security notice doesn’t appear to be compromised.

TorrentFreak asked BitTorrent Inc. at which vendor the hack originated and whether it intends to communicate the issue to forum users in a more direct manner, but we have yet to hear back.","tech","1",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

The personal details of 112,000 French police officers have been uploaded to Google Drive in a security breach just a fortnight after two officers were murdered at their home by a jihadist.

A mutual organisation which provides extra health and other insurance benefits for police says the details were uploaded by a disgruntled worker.

It has said the files are protected by a password and there is no reason to believe details have been accessed.

The files include postal addresses.

The security breach comes two weeks after a police commander and his partner were stabbed to death at their home near Paris.

Their young child survived the attack by Larossi Abballa, who said he was acting on a call from so-called Islamic State (IS) to ""kill infidels"".
RTL reports (in French) that the details of the officers, serving and retired, and their families, were uploaded to the Google Drive storage service on 2 June, where they were protected by a password.

It is unclear whether the person who uploaded the data took any further security measures to protect it.

Security experts say Google Drive does offer two-factor authentication but if it was not used, anybody who knew the password may have been able to access the data.

The mutual organisation concerned, Mutuelle Generale de la Police (MGP), told France TV Info that it had been the victim ""of a malicious act on the part of an employee"".

"209","VK","100,544,934","2016","Another Day, Another Hack: 100 Million Accounts for VK, Russia's Facebook

Accounts for over 100 million users of popular social media site VK.com are being traded on the digital underground.

Breach notification site LeakedSource obtained the data and published an analysis on Sunday. The hacker known as Peace, meanwhile, listed the data for sale on a dark web marketplace.

VK, heavily inspired by Facebook, is particularly popular in Russia, and has all the same features one might expect, including messaging, profiles, photo galleries, like buttons, and more. The site was founded by Pavel Durov, who sold his stake in VK and created the messaging app Telegram. As of 2014 VK had 100 million users, according to TechCrunch.

Peace provided Motherboard with a dataset containing a total of 100,544,934 records, and LeakedSource provided a smaller sample for verification purposes. The data contains first and last names, email address, phone numbers and passwords.

According to Peace, the passwords were already in plain text when the site was hacked, and were not cracked at a later date. Peace is selling the data for 1 bitcoin, or around $570 at today's exchange rates.

Out of 100 randomly selected email addresses from the larger dataset, 92 corresponded to active accounts on the site, Motherboard found. A Russian friend contacted by Motherboard confirmed that the password was correct.

While many of phone numbers were genuine, not all of the users had numbers listed. At the time of writing, a phone number is required upon registration, but that was not always the case.

Indeed, according to Peace, the site was hacked sometime between 2011 and 2013, although exactly when is unclear. Peace claimed to have access to another 71 million accounts, but decided not to sell them yet.

LeakedSource wrote on its blog that the data was provided by someone who used the alias ""Tessa88."" This is the same pseudonym that came up around the recent proliferation of user data from MySpace.

According to LeakedSource's analysis, the most popular password in the dataset was ""123456,"" with 709,067 appearances. Many other passwords were predictable, including ""qwerty,"" ""123123,"" and ""qwertyuiop.""

The vast majority of email addresses, according to LeakedSource, use the ""@mail.ru"" domain, with 41,132,524. Other Russian services dominate the list of top email domains.

Durov declined to comment.

The lesson: Huge datadumps of email addresses and passwords continue to surface. Again, the main lesson from all of these hacks is that users have to create a unique password for every site. This shouldn't be seen as a fancy, additional security step, but a fundamental one to stop hackers getting into different accounts. When the most popular sites on the internet, and the ones that hold our most personal information, are being breached, proper password use is a must.

Update 6 June: A VK spokesperson denied that the site had been breached, and told Motherboard in an email that the ""VK database hasn't been hacked. We are talking about old logins/passwords that had been collected by fraudsters in 2011-2012. All users' data mentioned in this database was changed compulsorily. Please remember that installing unreliable software on your devices may cause your data loss. For security reasons, we recommend enabling 2-step verification in profile settings and using a strong password.""","tech","4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

A teenage hacker is trying to avenge the death of 298 people by breaching totally random Russian websites.

A teenage hacker angry about the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 has gone on a hacking spree, apparently breaching several random Russian websites and spilling the private information on millions of Russian internet users.

The hacker, who calls himself Cyber Anakin in reference to the Star Wars character, told me that he didn't really put too much thought into picking its victims. All he cared, he said, was to hit Russian websites.

""I choose the targets randomly, as long as it's Russian,"" Cyber Anakin told Motherboard in a Twitter message. ""I hold consequentialist approach during the hack, meaning that I only care about the public shock among Russians as a result of the hack, and to show the irony that Russians can defend against Hitler but cannot defend against hacker [sic].""

""I choose the targets randomly, as long as it's Russian.""

Delusions of grandeur aside, Cyber Anakin seems to have really been able to hack into several websites and databases, including those of the news site and email provider km.ru, the videogame maker Nival.com.

Security researcher Troy Hunt, who maintains the website haveibeenpowned.com, a service that informs users whether they have been victimised in data breaches, confirmed that the data from Nival, as well as that from km.ru is legitimate.

Out of the two, the data stolen from km.ru is perhaps the most sensitive obtained by the hacker.

There are 1.5 million victims, according to Troy Hunt, a security researcher who independently analyzed the data. Other than emails, and encrypted passwords, the hacked database contains secret questions and answers in plaintext, meaning anyone in possession of the data can now hack into any victim's email addresses by pretending to be him or her. The database also contained dates of birth, email addresses, genders, and geographic location. (Km.ru did not respond to an email requesting comment.)

The Nival database contains similar data, such as birthdates, email addresses, genders, names, and usernames. (Nival did not respond to a request for comment.)

Cyber Anakin told me that these hacks are his way of getting ""revenge"" after the 2014 crash of MH17, which is widely believed to have been caused by missile shot either by pro-Russian rebels or perhaps even Russian soldiers.

The hacker claimed to know someone who had a relative die in that incident, though he declined to elaborate for privacy reasons.

""I can imagine and even feel the sadness that befell upon the relatives of MH17 victims back in July 17, 2014,"" he told me. ""After the MH17 tragedy back in 2014, I made a promise to myself that I am going to revenge against Russians for what they did against the flight.""

Whether hacking random Russian websites counts as revenge, that's up for debate. But it certainly shows that there are still a lot of websites out there with glaring security holes, which make for great targets for hackers with and without a cause.

Tens of millions of credentials reportedly stolen from an adult dating website called Fling.com have been put up for sale on the dark web. Currently listed on an underground marketplace called The Real Deal the information reportedly contains email addresses, plain text passwords, usernames, IP addresses and date of birth records. Additionally, the compromised data includes sexual preferences, whether the account was a free or paid version and the gender of the user.

The hacker responsible for selling the credentials, using the pseudonym 'peace_of_mind' claims the data dump contains over 40 million records. It is currently on sale for 0.8874 bitcoins which is equivalent to approximately £280 based on the exchange rate at the time of writing.

Fling.com is an adult-orientated website and social network in which members can create profiles, send personal messages and share explicit pictures. Under its terms of service, the website notes: ""We cannot ensure the security or privacy of information you provide through the internet, email, messaging or otherwise [...] you release us from any and all liability in connection with the breach of the security of such information.""

According to Vice Motherboard, the individual who manages the domain for the website has confirmed the legitimacy of the leaked data but claimed it was old information. ""We take internet security very seriously,"" the administrator said. ""Our site is free to join and we do not store any credit card information. We've investigated the sample data and it is from a breach that happened in 2011.""

Troy Hunt, a security researcher who runs the breach notification website 'HaveIBeenPwned', also analysed the Fling.com dataset and contacted a number of people included in the trove of usernames.

Hunt told IBTimes UK: ""It's just another example of an online asset you'd expect to remain secure being compromised. The plain text passwords make it particularly worrying as they had absolutely no protection in the database."" While one of the victims confirmed their leaked password was legitimate, another said they had never signed up for the dating website at all, Motherboard reported.

The leak is the latest in a long line of dating websites being targeted by hackers and follows similar incidents at Ashley Madison, Mate1, BeautifulPeople and Adult Friend Finder. In each of these cases, hundreds of thousands – if not millions – of sensitive records were compromised. While in the case of Ashley Madison alone, the release of information had severe consequences – including blackmail attempts, high-profile resignations and even suicide.

A hacker and a paid search engine for hacked data claim to have a massive database stolen from MySpace at some point in the last few years.

There's an oft-repeated adage in the world of cybersecurity: There are two types of companies, those that have been hacked, and those that don't yet know they have been hacked.

MySpace, the social media behemoth that was, is apparently in the second category. The same hacker who was selling the data of more than 164 million LinkedIn users last week now claims to have 360 million emails and passwords of MySpace users, which would be one of the largest leaks of passwords ever. And it looks like the data is being circulated in the underground by other hackers as well.

It's unclear when the data was stolen from MySpace, but both the hacker, who's known as Peace, and one of the operators of LeakedSource, a paid hacked data search engine that also claims to have the credentials, said it's from a past, unreported, breach.

Neither Peace nor LeakedSource provided a sample of the hacked data. But Motherboard gave LeakedSource the email addresses of three staffers and two friends who had an account on the site to verify that the data was real. In all five cases, LeakedSource was able to send back their password.

The database contains 427,484,128 passwords, but there are only 360,213,024 million emails, according to LeakedSource, which announced the leak on Friday in a blog post. Each record in the hacked dataset contains ""an email address, a username, one password and in some cases a second password,"" according to the site.

""Once data gets traded a few times, eventually it will make its way to somebody who is not trustworthy to keep it a secret, and then it will spread like branches of a tree.""

""Of the 360 million, 111,341,258 accounts had a username attached to it and 68,493,651 had a secondary password (some did not have a primary password),"" wrote LeakedSource, which provides subscribers, who pay between $2 a day to $265 a year, with access to what the site claims is a collection of more than 1.6 billion hacked or leaked records.

LeakedSource wrote that the data was provided by someone who goes by the alias Tessa88, but in an interview with Motherboard, an operator for the site said they were unaware of the real origins of the data breach, such as who originally breached MySpace, nor who has had the data ""this whole time"" or when the company was hacked. But this data was bound to leak eventually, they said.

""It's the nature of information. 'Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead,'"" the operator told me in an online chat. ""Once data gets traded a few times, eventually it will make its way to somebody who is not trustworthy to keep it a secret, and then it will spread like branches of a tree.""

MySpace did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The passwords were originally ""hashed"" with the SHA1 algorithm, which is known to be weak and easy to crack, LeakedSource wrote. What's worse, the company didn't ""salt"" the passwords in the hashing process. Salting means adding a series of random bytes to the end of passwords before hashing them to make them harder to be cracked.

That's why LeakedSource's operator told me they expect to crack 98 or 99 percent of them by the end of the month, though the operator declined to say how many have been already cracked.

While the social network, which was one of the largest site on the internet more than 10 years ago, is now just a shell of its former self, this is still a significant hack. The site, which recently boasted about crossing the threshold of one billion registered users, still had a reported 50 million unique visitors per month as of last year.

If the total numbers are accurate, this is one of the largest data thefts ever.

Also, if the total numbers are accurate, this is one of the largest data thefts ever. And, more importantly, this shows that at some point MySpace got hacked. And either the company never found out, or didn't disclose it, neither publicly nor to its users. If all the data indeed comes from MySpace, this would be the largest breach of emails and passwords ever, topping the list on the data breach awareness site Have I Been Pwned.

Hence, there are still risks for users, even in case of abandoned or dormant accounts, which might still contain personal data that could be leveraged for other attacks. Bottom line, if you still have a MySpace account, change your password. But, most importantly, you should change your password on other, more sensitive services if you were using the same password there too. And please, consider using a password manager such as LastPass or 1Password to help you use unique, strong, passwords for every different website.

UPDATE, 5:01 p.m. ET: On Friday afternoon, the hacker known as Peace put the MySpace hacked data up for sale on the dark web market The Real Deal. Peace is asking for 6 Bitcoin (roughly $2,800) for the stolen passwords and emails.

Updated 27 Oct 2016, 11:41pm

The personal data of 550,000 blood donors that includes information about ""at-risk sexual behaviour"" has been leaked from the Red Cross Blood Service in what has been described as Australia's largest security breach.

Key points:
Data from blood donor registration form posted insecurely online
Leak included identifying information and ""personal details"" of 550,000 donors
All copies of the data believed to be destroyed
The organisation said it was told on Wednesday that a file containing donor information was placed on an ""insecure computer environment"" and ""accessed by an unauthorised person"".

The file contained the information of blood donors from between 2010 and 2016.

The data came from an online application form and included ""personal details"" and identifying information including names, gender, addresses and dates of birth, a Red Cross statement said.

Red Cross Blood Service chief executive Shelly Park said ""due to human error"" the unsecured data had been posted on a website by a contractor who maintains and develops the Red Cross website.

""As an organisation, we are still in the process of completing our investigation and we have engaged forensic experts to help us with this,"" she said.

""We apologise and we acknowledge that this is unacceptable.""

Ms Park said, to her knowledge, all copies of the data had now been deleted and the risk of misuse of the data was low.

Red Cross message

Independent security expert Troy Hunt said he was contacted on Tuesday morning by an anonymous Twitter user who claimed to have his and his wife's personal details.

Mr Hunt said the anonymous user then sent him the data in a 1.74GB file.

He said he was never threatened or extorted by the Twitter user and contacted AusCert, a cyber emergency response team, who then notified the Red Cross of the breach.

Mr Hunt said he later deleted the file and understood the person who provided it had deleted their copy.

Data included answer to question about 'at-risk sexual activity'
Mr Hunt said the data included answers to a number of true-false eligibility questions, including one that asked donors whether they had engaged in ""at-risk sexual behaviour"" in the previous 12 months.

""Both the questions and answers mapped to the individuals were part of the dataset. That would be one of the most sensitive things in the breach, especially if you answered in the affirmative,"" he said.

Mr Hunt, who works with companies to prevent similar incidents from occurring, said as far as he was aware it was the largest data leak in Australia.

""We haven't seen one (a breach) of an Australian entity that's anywhere near this size,"" he said.

""We've certainly seen some very large global ones … things like the MySpace data breach, for example. We haven't seen one locally this big.""

The Red Cross Blood Service said it had been in contact with the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the Australian Federal Police about the breach.

Any donors concerned about the leak can contact the Red Cross via a dedicated hotline.

The Red Cross has expressed its ""deep disappointment"" and set up a link where those who have been impacted by the breach can seek assistance.","healthcare","4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"
"215","Telegram ","15,000,000","2016","Hackers break into Telegram, revealing 15 million users’ phone numbers

(Reuters) — Iranian hackers have compromised more than a dozen accounts on the Telegram instant messaging service and identified the phone numbers of 15 million Iranian users, the largest known breach of the encrypted communications system, cyber researchers told Reuters.

The attacks, which took place this year and have not been previously reported, jeopardized the communications of activists, journalists and other people in sensitive positions in Iran, where Telegram is used by some 20 million people, said independent cyber researcher Collin Anderson and Amnesty International technologist Claudio Guarnieri, who have been studying Iranian hacking groups for three years.

Telegram promotes itself as an ultra secure instant messaging system because all data is encrypted from start to finish, known in the industry as end-to-end encryption. A number of other messaging services, including Facebook Inc’s WhatsApp, say they have similar capabilities.

Headquartered in Berlin, Telegram says it has 100 million active subscribers and is widely used in the Middle East, including by the Islamic State militant group, as well as in Central and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

Telegram’s vulnerability, according to Anderson and Guarnieri, lies in its use of SMS text messages to activate new devices. When users want to log on to Telegram from a new phone, the company sends them authorization codes via SMS, which can be intercepted by the phone company and shared with the hackers, the researchers said.

Armed with the codes, the hackers can add new devices to a person’s Telegram account, enabling them to read chat histories as well as new messages.

“We have over a dozen cases in which Telegram accounts have been compromised, through ways that sound like basically coordination with the cellphone company,” Anderson said in an interview.

Telegram’s reliance on SMS verification makes it vulnerable in any country where cellphone companies are owned or heavily influenced by the government, the researchers said.

A spokesman for Telegram said customers can defend against such attacks by not just relying on SMS verification. Telegram allows — though it does not require — customers to create passwords, which can be reset with so-called “recovery” emails.

“If you have a strong Telegram password and your recovery email is secure, there’s nothing an attacker can do,” said Markus Ra, the spokesman.

Iranian officials were not available to comment. Iran has in the past denied government links to hacking.

Rocket Kitten
The Telegram hackers, the researchers said, belonged to a group known as Rocket Kitten, which used Persian-language references in their code and carried out “a common pattern of spearphishing campaigns reflecting the interests and activities of the Iranian security apparatus.”

Anderson and Guarnieri declined to comment on whether the hackers were employed by the Iranian government. Other cyber experts have said Rocket Kitten’s attacks were similar to ones attributed to Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards.

The researchers said the Telegram victims included political activists involved in reformist movements and opposition organizations. They declined to name the targets, citing concerns for their safety.

“We see instances in which people … are targeted prior to their arrest,” Anderson said. “We see a continuous alignment across these actions.”

The researchers said they also found evidence that the hackers took advantage of a programing interface built into Telegram to identify at least 15 million Iranian phone numbers with Telegram accounts registered to them, as well as the associated user IDs. That information could provide a map of the Iranian user base that could be useful for future attacks and investigations, they said.

“A systematic de-anonymization and classification of people who employ encryption tools (of some sort, at least) for an entire nation” has never been exposed before, Guarnieri said.

Ra said Telegram has blocked similar “mapping” attempts in the past and was trying to improve its detection and blocking strategies.

Cyber experts say Iranian hackers have become increasingly sophisticated, able to adapt to evolving social media habits. Rocket Kitten’s targets included members of the Saudi royal family, Israeli nuclear scientists, NATO officials and Iranian dissidents, U.S.-Israeli security firm Check Point said last November.

Popular in the Middle East
Telegram was founded in 2013 by Pavel Durov, known for starting VKontakte, Russia’s version of Facebook, before fleeing the country under pressure from the government.

While Facebook and Twitter are banned in Iran, Telegram is widely used by groups across the political spectrum. They shared content on Telegram “channels” and urged followers to vote ahead of Iran’s parliamentary elections in February 2016.

Last October, Durov wrote in a post on Twitter that Iranian authorities had demanded the company provide them with “spying and censorship tools.” He said Telegram ignored the request and was blocked for two hours on Oct. 20, 2015.

Ra said the company has not changed its stance on censorship and does not maintain any servers in Iran.

After complaints from Iranian activists, Durov wrote on Twitter in April that people in “troubled countries” should set passwords for added security.

Amir Rashidi, an internet security researcher at the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, has worked with Iranian hacking victims. He said he knew of Telegram users who were spied on even after they had set passwords.

Ra said that in those cases the recovery email had likely been hacked.

Anderson and Guarnieri will present their findings at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Thursday. Their complete research is set to be published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank, later this year.

Millions of accounts associated with video-sharing site Dailymotion, one of the biggest video platforms in the world, have been stolen.

A hacker extracted 85.2 million unique email addresses and usernames from the company's systems, but about one-in-five accounts -- roughly 18.3 million-- had associated passwords, which were scrambled with the bcrypt hashing function, making the passwords difficult to crack.

The hack is believed to have been carried out on Oct. 20 by a hacker, whose identity isn't known, according to LeakedSource, a breach notification service, which obtained the data.

Dailymotion launched in 2005 and is currently the 113rd most-visited website in the world, according to Alexa rankings.

When reached on Monday, a Dailymotion executive would not provide comment. But on Tuesday, the company admitted the breach in a blog post.

""The security of your account is very important to us and we take all necessary steps to identify any shortcomings and addressed. Therefore, as a precaution, we urge all our partners and users to now reset their passwords.""

A sample of the data was provided to ZDNet.

We verified the data by matching up plaintext passwords with the hashed password found against the email address using a readily available online tool. In one case, the email address and password combination were unique to Dailymotion, suggesting that the data could only have come from the video-sharing site.

We also reached out to a number of people whose email addresses were found in the data, but nobody responded by the time of publication.

But because of the password security and that only a portion of the accounts had associated passwords, the damage is somewhat limited for Dailymotion customers.

The web design platform Weebly was  hacked in February, according to the data breach notification site LeakedSource. Usernames and passwords for more than 43 million accounts were taken in the breach, although the passwords are secured with the strong hashing algorithm bcrypt.

Weebly said in an email to customers that user IP addresses were also taken in the breach.

“We do not believe that any customer website has been improperly accessed,” Weebly said in the notice to users.” The company also said that it does not store credit card information, making fraudulent charges unlikely.

LeakedSource said it received the Weebly database from an anonymous source and notified Weebly of the breach. In addition to the customer notification emails, LeakedSource claims that password resets are being issued — but, if you’re a Weebly user and you don’t receive a password reset, you probably want to change your password anyway.

Meanwhile, LeakedSource also identified data from Foursquare,  claiming that 22.5 million accounts were compromised in December 2013. The social media company disputes the findings, claiming that email addresses were simply cross-referenced with publicly available data from Foursquare. The data includes emails, usernames and Facebook and Twitter IDs, which could have been scraped from Foursquare’s API or search.

“We have done an internal investigation and no breach has occurred,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean police said on Thursday that the North’s main intelligence agency had stolen the personal data of more than 10 million customers of an online shopping mall in the South, in what they said was an attempt to obtain foreign currency.

The online mall, Interpark, was subjected in May to an online attack on a server that contained customers’ names, email addresses, telephone numbers and other personal data, the National Police Agency said.

Interpark did not learn about the breach until July 11, when it received an anonymous message threatening to publicize the leak of personal data unless it paid the equivalent of $2.6 billion in South Korea’s currency, the won. After the attack was reported, thousands of Interpark customers threatened to sue for damages. Most of the customers whose data was stolen were South Koreans.

On Thursday, the National Police Agency attributed the attack to the General Bureau of Reconnaissance, North Korea’s main spy agency. It said the intrusion had used some of the same code and internet protocol addresses as in previous digital breaches attributed to the North.

The message sent to Interpark also used vocabulary specific to the North Korean dialect, the police agency said.

The United States blacklisted the General Bureau of Reconnaissance after North Korean hackers were accused of breaking into the computer network of Sony Pictures in 2014.

It was unclear on Thursday whether, or how, the hackers had exploited the stolen data, other than in their effort at blackmail. But it showed that the North, whose access to hard currency has been hampered by sanctions over its nuclear arms program, was “using computer hacking technology to try to steal our people’s property in a criminal act of earning foreign currency,” the police said in a statement.

South Korea has blamed the North for a number of online attacks on banks, government websites and media companies since 2008. In March, its intelligence agency told lawmakers that North Korea had broken into the mobile phones of 40 national security officials. The North denied that accusation.

Almost every account password was cracked, thanks to the company's poor security practices. Even ""deleted"" accounts were found in the breach.

A massive data breach targeting adult dating and entertainment company Friend Finder Network has exposed more than 412 million accounts.

The hack includes 339 million accounts from AdultFriendFinder.com, which the company describes as the ""world's largest sex and swinger community.""

That also includes over 15 million ""deleted"" accounts that wasn't purged from the databases.

These were the biggest hacks, leaks and data breaches of 2016

And the list of attacks keeps getting longer...

On top of that, 62 million accounts from Cams.com, and 7 million from Penthouse.com were stolen, as well as a few million from other smaller properties owned by the company.

The data accounts for two decades' worth of data from the company's largest sites, according to breach notification LeakedSource, which obtained the data.

The attack happened at around the same time as one security researcher, known as Revolver, disclosed a local file inclusion flaw on the AdultFriendFinder site, which if successfully exploited could allow an attacker to remotely run malicious code on the web server.

But it's not known who carried out this most recent hack. When asked, Revolver denied he was behind the data breach, and instead blamed users of an underground Russian hacking site.

The attack on Friend Finder Networks is the second in as many years. The company, based in California and with offices in Florida, was hacked last year, exposing almost 4 million accounts, which contained sensitive information, including sexual preferences and whether a user was looking for an extramarital affair.

ZDNet obtained a portion of the databases to examine. After a thorough analysis, the data does not appear to contain sexual preference data unlike the 2015 breach, however.

The three largest site's SQL databases included usernames, email addresses, and the date of the last visit, and passwords, which were either stored in plaintext or scrambled with the SHA-1 hash function, which by modern standards isn't cryptographically as secure as newer algorithms.

LeakedSource said it was able to crack 99 percent of all the passwords from the databases.

The databases also included site membership data, such as if the user was a VIP member, browser information, the IP address last used to log in, and if the user had paid for items.

ZDNet verified the portion of data by contacting some of the users who were found in the breach.

One user (who we are not naming because of the sensitivity of the breach) confirmed he used the site once or twice, but said that the information they used was ""fake"" because the site requires users to sign up. Another confirmed user said he ""wasn't surprised"" by the breach.

Another two-dozen accounts were verified by enumerating disposable email accounts with the site's password reset function. (We have more on how we verify breaches here.)

When reached, Friend Finder Networks confirmed the site vulnerability, but would not outright confirm the breach.

""Over the past several weeks, FriendFinder has received a number of reports regarding potential security vulnerabilities from a variety of sources. Immediately upon learning this information, we took several steps to review the situation and bring in the right external partners to support our investigation,"" said Diana Ballou, vice president and senior counsel, in an email on Friday.

""While a number of these claims proved to be false extortion attempts, we did identify and fix a vulnerability that was related to the ability to access source code through an injection vulnerability,"" she said.

""FriendFinder takes the security of its customer information seriously and will provide further updates as our investigation continues,"" she added.

When pressed on details, Ballou declined to comment further.

But why Friend Finder Networks has held onto millions of accounts belonging to Penthouse.com customers is a mystery, given that the site was sold to Penthouse Global Media in February.

""We are aware of the data hack and we are waiting on FriendFinder to give us a detailed account of the scope of the breach and their remedial actions in regard to our data,"" said Kelly Holland, the site's chief executive, in an email on Saturday.

Holland confirmed that the site ""does not collect data regarding our members' sexual preferences.""

Another day, another hack originating from poorly maintained vBulletin software.

Nearly 800,000 accounts for popular porn site Brazzers have been exposed in a data breach. Although the data originated from the company's separate forum, Brazzers users who never signed up to the forum may also find their details included in the dump.

Motherboard was provided the dataset by breach monitoring site Vigilante.pw for verification purposes. The data contains 790,724 unique email addresses, and also includes usernames and plaintext passwords. (The set has 928,072 entries in all, but many are duplicates.)

Troy Hunt, a security researcher and creator of the website Have I Been Pwned? helped verify the dataset by contacting subscribers to his site, who confirmed a number of their details from the data.

""It's unfortunate that my information was included in the breach, but that's the risk you run making an account anywhere on the web,"" a Brazzers user, who asked to remain anonymous, told Motherboard in an email.

Another user whose email was included in the data, called John, wrote, ""I used throwaway login/pass for this very reason.""

Matt Stevens, public relations manager from Brazzers, told Motherboard in an email, ""This matches an incident which occurred in 2012 with our 'Brazzersforum,' which was managed by a third party. The incident occurred because of a vulnerability in the said third party software, the 'vBulletin' software, and not Brazzers itself.""

""That being said, users' accounts were shared between Brazzers and the 'Brazzersforum' which was created for user convenience. That resulted in a small portion of our user accounts being exposed and we took corrective measures in the days following this incident to protect our users,"" Stevens added.

Indeed, both Brazzers users who spoke to Motherboard said that they had not used Brazzersforum.

On the forum, which uses a separate URL from the main site, users could discuss different Brazzers porn scenes and stars, or request a new scenario they would like to see in future Brazzers productions.

At the time of writing, Brazzersforum is displaying an ""under maintenance"" message, and is unavailable to users.

""Note that the data provided contains many duplicates and non-functional accounts. We banned all non-active accounts in that list in case those usernames and passwords are re-used in the future,"" Stevens from Brazzers said.

""Brazzers takes the privacy and safety of its users very seriously,"" he added.

""We've seen a real spate of vBulletin breaches where the software had been left pretty much unattended and unloved""

Hunt said that, because some of the accounts were related to a forum, that arguably made the data even more sensitive than just a normal porn site account.

""When it's solely membership of an adult website, you know the person has an interest in adult material, which, whilst potentially embarrassing, tells you very little about them. Once they're commenting within a forum though, now you have very personal information about their intimate thoughts. We also know that forum breaches frequently include not just user credentials, but private messages as well, and those can be particularly revealing,"" he wrote in an email. Hunt added the data to Have I Been Pwned? on Monday.

""We've seen a real spate of vBulletin breaches where the software had been left pretty much unattended and unloved,"" he added. ""Vulnerabilities have been found and patches have been issued yet the admins have maintained the product and very well-known, easily exploited vulnerabilities have led to breaches like this one.""

Read More: The Rise of 'Have I Been Pwned?', an Invaluable Resource in the Hacking Age

A recent breach of a Grand Theft Auto fan site originated from vulnerabilities with vBulletin, and the software has been involved in many other breaches too. Often, the problem is that sites using vBulletin have been left in a state of disrepair, allowing hackers to leverage publicly known vulnerabilities and grab user details.

The anonymous Brazzers user told Motherboard, ""The only way to force change is to bring it to public opinion to encourage businesses to respect our data and put the proper security measures in place to secure it.""

The lesson: Like John, when signing up to websites, consider using a unique email address and password. That way, if your data is included in the breach of a sensitive website, it will likely be harder for others to personally identify you.

ClixSense, a site which pays users to view ads and take surveys, was the victim of a massive data breach compromising around 6.6 million user accounts.
Usually when there’s a data breach of this size, the information stolen contains usernames, passwords, and some other personal information, but due to the nature of ClixSense and the service it provided, home addresses, payment histories, and other banking details have also been compromised.

According to the message posted to PasteBin along with a sample of the stolen data, social security numbers, dates of birth, and some internal emails from ClixSense may also have been compromised.

Ars Technica reported this morning that about 2.2 million people have had their data posted to PasteBin over the weekend, reportedly just a taste of the 6.6 million user accounts that have been stolen.

ClixSense owner Jim Grago told Ars that ClixSense had been hijacked on September 4 but the firm managed to regain control of their DNS over Labor Day weekend. In addition to the user information stolen, it appears that the company’s internal email server was also compromised, including “70,000 emails” according to the post on PasteBin advertising the hack.

The hackers responsible stated in their PasteBin post that they intend to sell the user information they gathered, without disclosing a specific price. PasteBin has since removed the posts and the sample of the compromised user account information.

On September 11, ClixSense acknowledged the hack in a news post on its website, but did not disclose the extent of the data breach, nor the fact that user information had been compromised.

Users were forced to change their passwords shortly after the hack began, but if you’re a ClixSense user it would be a good idea to reset all of your current passwords for other services, and make sure your security questions don’t overlap with any of the information you provided to ClixSense — including your date of birth, address, or other identifying information.","tech","5",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not_Enough_Info"

The company is sending out password reset emails to users whose passwords were exposed.

Disqus has confirmed its web commenting system was hacked.

The company, which builds and provides a web-based comment plugin for news websites, said Friday that hackers stole more than 17.5 million email addresses in a data breach in July 2012.

About a third of those accounts contained passwords, salted and hashed using the weak SHA-1 algorithm, which has largely been deprecated in recent years in favor of stronger password scramblers. The data also contained sign-up dates and the date of the last login.

Some of the exposed user information dates back to 2007.

Many of the accounts don't have passwords because they signed up to the commenting tool using a third-party service, like Facebook or Google.

The theft was only discovered this week after the database was sent to Troy Hunt, who runs data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned, who then informed Disqus of the breach.

The company said in a blog post, posted less than a day after Hunt's private disclosure, that although there was no evidence of unauthorized logins, affected users will be emailed about the breach.

Users whose passwords were exposed will have their passwords force-reset.

The company warned users who have used their Disqus password on other sites to change the password on those accounts.

""Since 2012, as part of normal security enhancements, we've made significant upgrades to our database and encryption in order to prevent breaches and increase password security,"" said Jason Yan, chief technology officer, in the post.

Yan said that the company changed its password hashing to bcrypt, a much stronger password scrambler, in late 2012, and made other upgrades to improve security.

""Our team is still actively investigating this issue, but we wanted to share all relevant information as soon as possible,"" said Yan.

Daniel Ha, chief executive, told ZDNet that the company was looking into all responsible and necessary disclosures, with customers and government authorities.

Ha added that the stolen data represents less than 10 percent of the company's current user base. Since the breach, the number of website using its platform has increased by five-fold, he said.

The company says more than 50 million comments are submitted using its service every month.

Disqus joins several other companies, like LinkedIn, MySpace, and Yahoo, who have in the past year and a half revealed a historical data breach dating back to the turn of the decade.

Hunt, a security expert, praised the company's response.

""In the space of less than 24 hours after first learning of the breach, Disqus has managed to assess the breach data, establish a timeline of events, reset passwords on impacted accounts, craft a very transparent announcement and liaise candidly with the press,"" said Hunt.

"224","RootsWeb","300,000","2017","Leaky RootsWeb Server Exposes Some Ancestry.com User Data

Ancestry.com closes parts of its community-driven genealogy site RootsWeb as it investigates a leaky server that exposed thousands of passwords, email addresses and usernames to the public internet.

Ancestry.com said it closed portions of its community-driven genealogy site RootsWeb as it investigated a leaky server that exposed 300,000 passwords, email addresses and usernames to the public internet.

In a statement issued over the weekend, Chief Information Security Officer of Ancestry.com Tony Blackham said a file containing the user data was publicly exposed on a RootsWeb server.

“Approximately 55,000 of these were used both on RootsWeb and one of the Ancestry sites, and the vast majority of those were from free trial or currently unused accounts. Additionally, we found that about 7,000 of those password and email address combinations matched credentials for active Ancestry customers,” Blackham wrote.

On Wednesday, Ancestry.com told Threatpost it believed the data was exposed on November 2015. The data resided on RootsWeb’s infrastructure, and is not linked to Ancestry.com’s site and services. Ancestry.com said RootsWeb has “millions” of members who use the site to share family trees, post user-contributed databases and host thousands of messaging boards.

The company said RootsWeb doesn’t host sensitive information such as credit card data or social security numbers. It added, there are no indications data exposed to the public internet has been accessed by a malicious third party. The company declined to specify how and why the data was stored insecurely on the server.

The exposure of data was first brought to Ancestry.com’s attention on Dec. 20 when Troy Hunt, who runs the data breach repository HaveIBeenPwned.com, reported to the company the existence of the file on RootsWeb’s server.

According to a tweet by Hunt the publicly exposed data contained plain text passwords.

“Our Information Security Team reviewed the details of this file, and confirmed that it contains information related to users of Rootsweb’s surname list information, a service we retired earlier this year,” Blackham said.

The company said as it investigates some of RootsWeb’s services would be taken offline. On Wednesday, visitors were greeted with the message:
“Rootsweb is currently unavailable. We have been in the process of improving the site throughout 2017, and as a result of an issue we recently became aware of, we have taken the site offline while we work to resolve it.”

Customers were told as a result of some sections of RootsWeb being taken offline it “may not be able to salvage everything” as Ancestry.com works to resolve this issue and “improve the site’s infrastructure.”

Ancestry.com declined to say how long the site would have limited functionality. However, in a comment section of Ancestry.com a company representative told a customer: “We do not have a specific timeline at this point. We hope it will take no more than a few weeks to resolve these issues.”

Blackham said 55,000 impacted accounts will be “locked” and users trying to access them will be forced to create a new password. Affected users will also be notified by email of the user data exposure.

“We believe the intrusion was limited to the RootsWeb surname list, where someone was able to create the file of older RootsWeb usernames and passwords as a direct result of how part of this open community was set up, an issue we are working to rectify,” Blackham said. “This issue involves less than one percent of our users, so there is a very good chance your account wasn’t involved.”

Over the past several days RootsWeb users have peppered Blackham’s security update blog post with passionate requests to preserve user data and return functionality.

“I use several Rootsweb sites daily for my research and various others on a regular basis. PLEASE restore access soon!” wrote a user named Heather.

The company suspects the attack is connected to the same ""state-sponsored actor"" believed to be behind a massive 2014 breach.

Yahoo has revealed that 32 million is the number of user accounts accessed in the past two years by hackers who used forged cookies to log in without a password.

The company said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that the cookie caper is likely connected to the ""same state-sponsored actor"" thought to be behind a separate, 2014 breach that resulted in the theft of user information from 500 million user accounts.

""Based on the investigation, we believe an unauthorized third party accessed the company's proprietary code to learn how to forge certain cookies,"" Yahoo said in its annual filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company went on to say the forged cookies have been invalidated to prevent further use on accounts.

Yahoo revealed the cookie caper in December, but the news was largely overlooked because the company announced at the same time that it had identified yet another security breach, which took place in 2013. In that breach, hackers stole information on 1 billion Yahoo accounts.

The scope of the cookie caper was revealed the same day Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said she would forgo her annual bonus and any 2017 equity in response to findings from an investigation by the company's board into the hacks. Ronald Bell, Yahoo's general counsel and secretary, also resigned as of Wednesday after the company revealed that senior executives and Yahoo's legal team didn't sufficiently pursue the security incidents.

Uber said it has hired Matt Olsen, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency and director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as an adviser. He will help the company restructure its security teams. Uber hired Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm owned by FireEye Inc., to investigate the hack.The company said its investigation found that Salle Yoo, the outgoing chief legal officer who has been scrutinized for her responses to other matters, hadn’t been told about the incident. Her replacement, Tony West, will start at Uber on Wednesday and has been briefed on the cyberattack.Uber Paid Hackers to Delete Stolen Data on 57 Million People

Hackers stole the personal data of 57 million customers and drivers from Uber Technologies Inc., a massive breach that the company concealed for more than a year. This week, the ride-hailing firm ousted its chief security officer and one of his deputies for their roles in keeping the hack under wraps, which included a $100,000 payment to the attackers.

Compromised data from the October 2016 attack included names, email addresses and phone numbers of 50 million Uber riders around the world, the company told Bloomberg on Tuesday. The personal information of about 7 million drivers was accessed as well, including some 600,000 U.S. driver’s license numbers. No Social Security numbers, credit card information, trip location details or other data were taken, Uber said.

“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it.”

At the time of the incident, Uber was negotiating with U.S. regulators investigating separate claims of privacy violations. Uber now says it had a legal obligation to report the hack to regulators and to drivers whose license numbers were taken. Instead, the company paid hackers to delete the data and keep the breach quiet. Uber said it believes the information was never used but declined to disclose the identities of the attackers.

“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as chief executive officer in September, said in an emailed statement. “We are changing the way we do business.”

After Uber’s disclosure Tuesday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into the hack, his spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said. The company was also sued for negligence over the breach by a customer seeking class-action status.

Hackers have successfully infiltrated numerous companies in recent years. The Uber breach, while large, is dwarfed by those at Yahoo, MySpace, Target Corp., Anthem Inc. and Equifax Inc. What’s more alarming are the extreme measures Uber took to hide the attack. The breach is the latest scandal Khosrowshahi inherits from his predecessor, Travis Kalanick.

Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and former CEO, learned of the hack in November 2016, a month after it took place, the company said. Uber had just settled a lawsuit with the New York attorney general over data security disclosures and was in the process of negotiating with the Federal Trade Commission over the handling of consumer data. Kalanick declined to comment on the hack.

Joe Sullivan, the outgoing security chief, spearheaded the response to the hack last year, a spokesman told Bloomberg. Sullivan, a onetime federal prosecutor who joined Uber in 2015 from Facebook Inc., has been at the center of much of the decision-making that has come back to bite Uber this year. Bloomberg reported last month that the board commissioned an investigation into the activities of Sullivan’s security team. This project, conducted by an outside law firm, discovered the hack and the failure to disclose, Uber said.

Here’s how the hack went down: Two attackers accessed a private GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers and then used login credentials they obtained there to access data stored on an Amazon Web Services account that handled computing tasks for the company. From there, the hackers discovered an archive of rider and driver information. Later, they emailed Uber asking for money, according to the company.

A patchwork of state and federal laws require companies to alert people and government agencies when sensitive data breaches occur. Uber said it was obligated to report the hack of driver’s license information and failed to do so.

“At the time of the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the data and shut down further unauthorized access by the individuals,” Khosrowshahi said. “We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts.”

Uber has earned a reputation for flouting regulations in areas where it has operated since its founding in 2009. The U.S. has opened at least five criminal probes into possible bribes, illicit software, questionable pricing schemes and theft of a competitor’s intellectual property, people familiar with the matters have said. The San Francisco-based company also faces dozens of civil suits.

U.K. regulators including the National Crime Agency are also looking into the scale of the breach. London and other governments have previously taken steps toward banning the service, citing what they say is reckless behavior by Uber.

In January 2016, the New York attorney general fined Uber $20,000 for failing to promptly disclose an earlier data breach in 2014. After last year’s cyberattack, the company was negotiating with the FTC on a privacy settlement even as it haggled with the hackers on containing the breach, Uber said. The company finally agreed to the FTC settlement three months ago, without admitting wrongdoing and before telling the agency about last year’s attack.

The new CEO said his goal is to change Uber’s ways. Uber said it informed New York’s attorney general and the FTC about the October 2016 hack for the first time on Tuesday. Khosrowshahi asked for the resignation of Sullivan and fired Craig Clark, a senior lawyer who reported to Sullivan. The men didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Khosrowshahi said in his emailed statement: “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.”

The company said its investigation found that Salle Yoo, the outgoing chief legal officer who has been scrutinized for her responses to other matters, hadn’t been told about the incident. Her replacement, Tony West, will start at Uber on Wednesday and has been briefed on the cyberattack.

The company plans to release a statement to customers saying it has seen “no evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident.” Uber said it will provide drivers whose licenses were compromised with free credit protection monitoring and identity theft protection.","tech","1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"
"227","Wonga","270,000","2017","Wonga data breach could affect nearly 250,000 UK customers
 This article is more than 2 years old
Personal details from hundreds of thousands of accounts may have been illegally accessed, admits payday lender

More than a quarter of a million customers of payday loan firm Wonga are being warned that their personal data may have been stolen in a data breach at the firm.

The online lender said it was “urgently investigating illegal and unauthorised access” to the personal data of some of its customers in the UK and Poland. It is understood that the breach could affect up to 270,000 current and former customers, including 245,000 in the UK. The company would not disclose where it had taken place.

The lender, which offers loans at interest rates starting at 1,286% a year, became aware of a problem last week but did not realise until Friday that data could be accessed externally. It alerted the authorities and started to contact borrowers on Saturday to make them aware of the problem, and give details of a dedicated customer services phone line for those affected.

Customers who are thought to have been affected have received a message from the payday lender telling them: “We believe there may have been illegal and unauthorised access to some of your personal data on your Wonga.com account.”

The message said that Wonga was working to establish the full details but data breached “may have included one or more of the following: name, email address, home address, phone number, the last four digits of your card number (but not the whole number) and/or your bank account number and sort code.”

It went on to say that the lender believed Wonga accounts and passwords had not been compromised, but customers were advised to look out for unusual activity across their accounts. In a statement the firm said: “We are working closely with authorities and we are in the process of informing affected customers. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused.”

The breach will be a blow to Wonga, which has in recent years attempted to improve its reputation following a series of controversies. The lender, which advertised heavily on TV and through football sponsorships, was found by the financial regulator to have made loans to customers who could not afford to repay them and to have chased bad debts with letters from a fake law firm. New directors have replaced the firm’s original founders, a three-month loan launched alongside the short-term payday loan, and marketing has been changed to appeal to a better-off audience.

However, it has been hard hit by tougher rules on lending, introduced when the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took on stewardship of the sector. The latest set of results showed that the firm made a pre-tax loss of £80.2m in 2015, up from £38.1m the year before.

There was no sign of the breach on the lender’s website, which carried its usual information on how to apply for its loans. It has alerted the police, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the FCA. The ICO regulates firms’ use and care of people’s personal details, although financial services companies are not obliged to inform it of any breach. A spokesperson for the organisatio said: “All organisations have a responsibility to keep customers’ personal information secure. Where we find this has not happened, we can investigate and may take enforcement action.”

Wonga is the latest in a long line of companies to discover that information they hold on their customers has been compromised. In November, Tesco Bank suspended online transactions after £2.5m was stolen from 9,000 customers, while mobile phone operator Three said information from 130,000 users had been compromised when its systems were breached. A cyber attack on phone company Talk Talk in 2015 resulted in a £400,000 fine from the ICO after it found the firm “could have been prevented if TalkTalk had taken basic steps to protect customers’ information”.

On Twitter, some of Wonga’s customers were expressing concern about the breach and complaining that they were struggling to get onto Wonga’s website to change their account passwords. One tweeted the @OfficialWonga feed to say: “Received an email that my details may have been hacked. Please can you tell me if this is real? Been on hold for ages.”","financial","4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

Miffed with Snapchat CEO’s alleged comments on expansion by calling India a poor country, Indian hackers claim to leak data of 1.7 million users.

Snapchat, the popular social networking platform for sharing photo and video status recently came into news for wrong reasons. #BoycottSnapchat and #Uninstall_Snapchat were trending on Twitter over the weekend, with the platform facing outrage from Indian users. The issue came under the light after a former Snapchat employee alleged that CEO Evan Spiegel had no plans to expand the business to ‘poor countries’ like India, and the app was only meant for “rich people.” Now, the Anonymous Indian hacker group has reportedly claimed to leak the database of 1.7 million Snapchat users.

Last year, the Indian hacking group found some vulnerabilities in Snapchat’s database after which they siphoned details of nearly 1.7 million users, DailyMail reports. To mark their resentment against Spiegel’s remarks for India, the hacker group made the Snapchat database of 1.7 million users available on the darknet. The hackers are among one of the top bug bounty hunters looking to find vulnerabilities in software and services of IT giants. 

The hackers had found the bug last year, but never used the data. However, the ‘arrogance’ of CEO Spiegel miffed them, the publication reports. Also, until Spiegel apologizes for his remarks, the group threatens to carry out an ‘intensive strike’ against the company. While the hackers claim to have leaked the data, Snapchat is yet to confirm any successful data breach or leak yet. BGR India has reached out to Snapchat for a comment, and will update the copy after getting the response. 

Meanwhile, Snapchat has turned down the allegations on CEO comments by saying “This is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It’s available worldwide to download for free.” Furthermore, Snapchat was also accused of showing inflated user data and “misinformed about key metrics” to the investors. 

The company spokesperson further added saying, “Snap did not give investors misstated user metrics back in 2015; nor did Snap employees commit any of the panoply of alleged bad acts that litter Pompliano’s complaint. Snap will demonstrate as much at the appropriate time in the appropriate forum.” 

Besides users outraging on social media to boycott and uninstall the app, Snapchat ratings on Apple’s App Store have dropped from ‘five star’ to ‘one star.’ At the time of filing this story, Snapchat has a rating of ‘four star’ on Google Play store.","tech","1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

 This article is more than 2 years old
Millions of passwords also contained in breach, a result of spammers collecting information in attempt to break in to users’ email accounts

More than 700m email addresses, as well as a number of passwords, have leaked publicly thanks to a misconfigured spambot, in one of the largest data breaches ever.

The number of real humans’ contact details contained in the dump is likely to be lower, however, due to the number of fake, malformed and repeated email addresses contained in the dataset, according to data breach experts.

Troy Hunt, an Australian computer security expert who runs the Have I Been Pwned site, which notifies subscribers when their data ends up in breaches, wrote in a blog post: “The one I’m writing about today is 711m records, which makes it the largest single set of data I’ve ever loaded into HIBP. Just for a sense of scale, that’s almost one address for every single man, woman and child in all of Europe.”

It contains almost twice the records, once sanitised, than those contained in the River City Media breach from March, previously the largest breach from a spammer.

The data was available because the spammers failed to secure one of their servers, allowing any visitor to download many gigabytes of information without needing any credentials. It is impossible to know how many others besides the spammer who compiled the database have downloaded their own copies.

While there are more than 700m email addresses in the data, however, it appears many of them are not linked to real accounts. Some are incorrectly scraped from the public net, while others appear to have been simply guessed at by adding words such as “sales” in front of a standard domain to generate, for example, “sales@newspaper.com”.

There are also millions of passwords contained in the breach, apparently a result of the spammers collecting information in an attempt to break in to users’ email accounts and send spam under their names. But, Hunt says, the majority of the passwords appear to have been collated from previous leaks: one set mirrors the 164m stolen from LinkedIn in May 2016, while another set mirrors 4.2m of the ones stolen from Exploit.In, another pre-existing database of stolen passwords.

“Finding yourself in this data set unfortunately doesn’t give you much insight into where your email address was obtained from nor what you can actually do about it,” Hunt says. “I have no idea how this service got mine, but even for me with all the data I see doing what I do, there was still a moment where I went ‘ah, this helps explain all the spam I get’.”

The leak is not the only major breach announced today. Video games reseller CEX notified customers that an online security breach may have leaked as many as 2m accounts, including full names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers. Card information was also contained in the breach “in a small number of instances”, but the newest financial data dates to 2009, meaning it has likely expired for those users.

“We take the protection of customer data extremely seriously and have always had a robust security programme in place which we continually reviewed and updated to meet the latest online threats,” the company said in a statement. “Clearly however, additional measures were required to prevent such a sophisticated breach occurring and we have therefore employed a cybersecurity specialist to review our processes. Together we have implemented additional advanced measures of security to prevent this from happening again.”","tech","4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

The app maker's database wasn't protected with a password, leaving exposed its users' most private information.

Personal data belonging to over 31 million customers of a popular virtual keyboard app has leaked online, after the app's developer failed to secure the database's server.

The server is owned by Eitan Fitusi, co-founder of AI.type, a customizable and personalizable on-screen keyboard, which boasts more than 40 million users across the world.

But the server wasn't protected with a password, allowing anyone to access the company's database of user records, totaling more than 577 gigabytes of sensitive data.

The database appears to only contain records on the app's Android users.

The discovery was found by security researchers at the Kromtech Security Center, which posted details of the exposure alongside ZDNet. The data was only secured after several attempts to contact Fitusi, who acknowledged the security lapse this weekend. The server has since been secured, but Fitusi did not respond when we asked for comment.

Each record contains a basic collected data, including the user's full name, email addresses, and how many days the app was installed. Each record also included a user's precise location, including their city and country.

Other records are significantly more detailed. The app has a free version, which per its privacy policy collects more data than the paid version, which the company uses to monetize with advertising.

More complete records also include the device's IMSI and IMEI number, the device's make and model, its screen resolution, and the device's specific Android version.

A large portion of the records also included the user's phone number and the name of their cell phone provider, and in some cases their IP address and name of their internet provider if connected to Wi-Fi. Many records contain specific details of a user's public Google profile, including email addresses, dates of birth, genders, and profile photos.

We also found several tables of contact data uploaded from a user's phone. One table listed 10.7 million email addresses, while another contained 374.6 million phone numbers. It's not clear for what reason the app uploaded email addresses and phone numbers of contacts on users' phones.

Several tables contained lists of each app installed on a user's device, such as banking apps and dating apps.

It's not unusual for on-screen keyboards to have wide-ranging access to some of the highest levels of Android permissions. Android will warn users that keyboards ""may be able to collect all the text that you type, including personal data like passwords and credit card numbers."" AI.type is no exception, with read access to contact data, text messages, photos and video access and other on-device storage, record audio, and full network access.

For its part, AI.type says on its website that user's privacy ""is our main concern."" Any text entered on the keyboard ""stays encrypted and private,"" says the company.

But the database wasn't encrypted. We also found evidence that text entered on the keyboard does get recorded and stored by the company, though to what extent remains unclear.

The company also promises to ""never share your data or learn from password fields,"" but we saw one table containing more than 8.6 million entries of text that had been entered using the keyboard, which included private and sensitive information, like phone numbers, web search terms, and in some cases concatenated email addresses and corresponding passwords.

Bob Diachenko, head of communications at Kromtech Security Center, warned of the dangers of using free apps.

""Theoretically, it is logical that anyone who has downloaded and installed the Ai.Type virtual keyboard on their phone has had all of their phone data exposed publicly online,"" he told ZDNet. ""This presents a real danger for cyber criminals who could commit fraud or scams using such detailed information about the user.""

""It raises the question once again if it is really worth it for consumers to submit their data in exchange for free or discounted products or services that gain full access to their devices,"" he added.

""It is clear that data is valuable and everyone wants access to it for different reasons,"" he said. ""Some want to sell the data they collect, others use it for targeted marketing, predictive artificial intelligence, and cyber criminals want to use it to make money in more and more creative ways.""","tech","4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

A hacker provided Motherboard with a large cache of customer information, databases, and more.

The hackers have been hacked. Motherboard has obtained 900 GB of data related to Cellebrite, one of the most popular companies in the mobile phone hacking industry. The cache includes customer information, databases, and a vast amount of technical data regarding Cellebrite's products.

The breach is the latest chapter in a growing trend of hackers taking matters into their own hands, and stealing information from companies that specialize in surveillance or hacking technologies.

Cellebrite is an Israeli company whose main product, a typically laptop-sized device called the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), can rip data from thousands of different models of mobile phones. That data can include SMS messages, emails, call logs, and much more, as long as the UFED user is in physical possession of the phone.

Cellebrite is popular with US federal and state law enforcement, and, according to the hacked data, possibly also with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey.

The data appears to have been taken, at least in part, from servers related to Cellebrite's website. The cache includes alleged usernames and passwords for logging into Cellebrite databases connected to the company's my.cellebrite domain. This section of the site is used by customers to, among other things, access new software versions.

Motherboard verified the email addresses in the cache by attempting to create accounts on Cellebrite's customer login portal. In the majority of cases, this was not possible because the email address was already in use. A customer included in the data confirmed some of their details.

The dump also contains what appears to be evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices.

According to the hacker, and judging by timestamps on some of the files, some of the data may have been pulled from Cellebrite servers last year.

""Cellebrite recently experienced unauthorized access to an external web server,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday after Motherboard informed it of the breach.

""The company is conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach. The impacted server included a legacy database backup of my.Cellebrite, the company's end user license management system. The company had previously migrated to a new user accounts system. Presently, it is known that the information accessed includes basic contact information of users registered for alerts or notifications on Cellebrite products and hashed passwords for users who have not yet migrated to the new system,"" the statement continues.

Cellebrite advised customers to change their passwords as a precaution, and added that it is working with relevant authorities to assist in their investigation.

Access to Cellebrite's systems has been traded among a select few in IRC chat rooms, according to the hacker.

""To be honest, had it not been for the recent stance taken by Western governments no one would have known but us,"" the hacker told Motherboard. The hacker expressed disdain for recent changes in surveillance legislation.

In 2014 a hacker calling themselves ""PhineasFisher"" publicly released 40GB of data from surveillance company Gamma International. Gamma makes intrusion software that can remotely switch on a target's webcam, siphon off their emails, and much more. The following year, PhineasFisher targeted Italian company Hacking Team, and published a trove of emails and other internal documents from the company.

Although the terms of this Cellebrite breach are somewhat different—the hacker has not dumped the files online for anyone to download—similarities seem to remain, especially in the hacker's vigilante motivation.

The hacker, however, remained vague as to the true extent of what they had done to Cellebrite's systems.

""I can't say too much about what has been done,"" the hacker told Motherboard. ""It's one thing to slap them, it's a very different thing to take pictures of [their] balls hanging out.""","tech","2",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

A vulnerability in a mobile application that many Israelis use to pay their water or other municipal bills may have left 860,000 – 1,000,000 users at risk of account takeover or theft of their personal information.

The Waterly app, by M.G.A.R. Ltd,  allows users to sign up to pay their water bills. As part of the process, signing up creates an account for the user with the Pay24 service. That service allows the user to see all of their municipal bills in one account and to pay them through bill2mail. Account information may include connected data such as personal code, properties owned, contact details, and partial credit card numbers if credit card payments are made via the site.

The researchers estimate that Pay24 serves well over 1,000,000 account holders.

The vulnerability was in the bill2mail feature which was rolled out in Waterly at some date unknown to DataBreaches.net. According to “754ch1,” the independent security researcher who discovered it and who asked that we not use his real name, there was inadequate authentication of users, allowing anyone to create an account “using whatever municipal ID number they chose, with no checks in place to ensure that they were really the account owner.”

By inputting any municipal ID, the attacker – or even someone accidentally fat-fingering their ID – could gain full privileges to another’s account, “754ch1” told us:
This would potentially allow the attacker to route all victims’ municipal bills to his own desired email address. Furthermore, the breach, if abused, exposed many personal details about the victims, including their municipal bills and history of payments, debts to the city, a personal code for identification over the phone (great for social engineering), contact details and credit card details if inputted.

The vulnerability in bill2mail did not affect just the Waterly app, 754ch1 informs us, but also affected other municipal apps that are also under the MAGR umbrella.

754ch1 reported the vulnerability to CERT, who contacted MAGR.  Within two weeks, the vulnerability was remediated. Once it was addressed, the report was disclosed publicly and  covered on national television in Israel.

Although MAGR issued a statement affirming their commitment to privacy and security and thanking the researcher, they did not reveal whether they had found any evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited.","tech","3",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"

Sweden's security police Säpo has investigated the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen) after information about all vehicles in the country – including police and military – was made available to IT workers in Eastern Europe who had not gone through the usual security clearance checks when the agency outsourced its IT maintenance to IBM in 2015.

The scandal hit the headlines in Sweden when it emerged that former director-general Maria Ågren – who was fired for undisclosed reasons in January 2017 – had been fined 70,000 kronor after the probe found her guilty of being ""careless with secret information"".

IBM administrators in the Czech Republic were given full access to all data and logs, reports Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN) which has seen the Säpo investigation documents. Firewalls and communications were meanwhile maintained by a company in Serbia.

One Transport Agency staff member described the outsourcing without proper security checks as handing over ""the keys to the Kingdom"" in an interview with Säpo, reports DN.

""The fact that a security check has not been made is serious. That means you have not tested the people's loyalty and don't know if you can trust them from the Swedish side. In the case of Serbia there's a fairly close relationship between the Serbian and Russian intelligence services. In the worst case, foreign intelligence services have been given an access route into the computer systems,"" security expert Johan Wiktorin told DN.

""I think it is serious that security protection is not taken seriously at so many government agencies, including the Transport Agency in this case,"" prosecutor Ewamari Häggkvist told Swedish public radio.

""It is not forbidden in Sweden to place data services in other countries, even if you're an authority that holds secret information. But what it's about is that people need security clearance to handle such data, and that's where they failed.""

The maintenance of the Transport Agency's vehicle and licence register was outsourced to IBM in April 2015 in order to save money. But the transfer took place under time pressure, because the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) which previously ran the register had already started letting staff go, and Ågren said she saw no other option than to bypass the usual security rules.

It is not known whether the security glitch caused any major damage. The question of whether or not Sweden's national security was harmed is censored in the Säpo report.

Swedish authorities' IT security has come under fire several times in the past year. Last year the National Audit Office (Riksrevisionen) scrutinized nine state-controlled agencies and found that it was not ""a sufficiently high priority (…) in relation to the risks that exist"".

Last month the centre-left government presented a new national strategy for information and cyber security.

""If you have information critical to society it is not a good idea to store it somewhere where you can't control it. The risk of using foreign cloud services is that you can't control who could be able to access the information. If we're talking about an attacker who is a high-capacity foreign state that type of outsourcing carries obvious risks,"" Interior Minister Anders Ygeman was quoted by the TT newswire as saying at the time.

Devices contained ID card numbers, addresses and mobile numbers
In what could be one of Hong Kong’s most significant data breaches ever, the personal information of the city’s 3.7 million voters was possibly compromised after the Registration and Electoral Office reported two laptop computers went missing at its backup venue for the chief executive election.
The devices also stored the names of the 1,200 electors on the Election Committee who selected Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as Hong Kong’s new chief executive on Sunday.

The two computers were stolen from a room at the AsiaWorld-Expo on Lantau, which the office described as the election’s “fallback venue”.
The leadership election was held on Sunday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
While the committee members’ full names are publicly available information, the personal data of Hong Kong’s voters could include their ID card numbers, addresses and mobile phone numbers.
The office said the computers had been put in a locked room. It reported the case to police.

The leadership election was held on Sunday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.

While the committee members’ full names are publicly available information, the personal data of Hong Kong’s voters could include their ID card numbers, addresses and mobile phone numbers.

The office said the computers had been put in a locked room. It reported the case to police.
The case involves a huge amount of personal data. The office is going to launch a probe
privacy commissioner spokesman
In a statement, the office said there had so far been no information to indicate that the relevant data had been “leaked”. It also stressed the data had been encrypted.
Police said they received a report about the stolen computers around 4.40pm Monday. The case was being treated as theft and no arrests had been made. New Territories South regional crime unit was investigating.
A spokesman for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it had received “verbal notification” of the case from the electoral office earlier Monday.
“They stressed that the data had been encrypted,” he said. “The case involves a huge amount of personal data. The office is going to launch a probe.”
The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said it had received a report from the electoral office that the computers were found to have been stolen around Monday afternoon.

A spokesman for the AsiaWorld Expo said it had no comment.
Election Committee member Fung Wai-wah said he was shocked to learn what had happened. “We had not been told there was a backup centre for the chief executive election,” he said.
Another committee member, lawmaker Charles Mok, said he found it “puzzling” that general voters’ data had been stored alongside that of committee members. “Perhaps they didn’t put the voters’ data in a proper place after last year’s legislative elections and then the devices were used for the chief executive election,” he added.
Hong Kong’s data privacy pioneer lowers his guard
Last September, a computer belonging to the University of Hong Kong’s department of medicine kept at Queen Mary Hospital was stolen. It contained the personal details of some 3,675 patients.
In reply to a lawmaker enquiry last June, the bureau said during the period from June 2013 to May 2016, the privacy commissioner’s office received a total of 253 notifications of data breach incidents.

"235","River City Media","1,370,000,000","2017","One of the largest spam operations in the world has exposed its entire operation to the public, leaking its database of 1.37bn email addresses thanks to a faulty backup.
As well as email addresses, the holy grail of the spam operation, personal information including real names, IP addresses and physical addresses have also been leaked, though on a smaller scale than the email information that makes up the bulk of the dataset.
According to security researchers at MacKeeper, the leaked information stems from an operation called River City Media, an email marketing firm that sends up to a billion messages a day to spam filters across the world.
“The situation presents a tangible threat to online privacy and security as it involves a database of 1.4bn email accounts combined with real names, user IP addresses, and often physical address,” said MacKeeper’s Chris Vickery. “Chances are that you, or at least someone you know, is affected.”
Vickery hasn’t managed to fully verify the leak, but says he has found addresses he knows are accurate in the database. And the source of the data, a snapshot of a backup made at some point in January 2017, accidentally published to the internet without any password protection, adds more credibility to the leak.
“Well-informed individuals did not choose to sign up for bulk advertisements over a billion times,” Vickery says. “The most likely scenario is a combination of techniques. One is called co-registration. That’s when you click on the ‘Submit’ or ‘I agree’ box next to all the small text on a website. Without knowing it, you have potentially agreed your personal details can be shared with affiliates of the site.”
Anti-spam organisation Spamhaus, working alongside MacKeeper and Vickery, has used the information contained in the leak to add River City Media’s details to its database, blacklisting the firm’s entire infrastructure.
The breach is so large that when Vickery initially reported that he had access to a leaked dataset containing 1.4bn records, India’s national government issued a statement denying that it was the source – the country’s federal ID system is one of the few databases in the world containing more than a billion individuals, and speculation ran rampant until Vickery released the actual information.

"236","DaFont","700,000","2017","A popular font sharing site DaFont.com has been hacked, exposing the site's entire database of user accounts.
Usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords of 699,464 user accounts were stolen in the breach, carried out earlier this month, by a hacker who would not divulge his name.
The passwords were scrambled with the deprecated MD5 algorithm, which nowadays is easy to crack. As such, the hacker unscrambled over 98 percent of the passwords into plain text. The site's main database also contains the site's forum data, including private messages, among other site information. At the time of writing, there were over half-a-million posts on the site's forums.
The hacker told ZDNet that he carried out his attack after he saw that others had also purportedly stolen the site's database.
""I heard the database was getting traded around so I decided to dump it myself -- like I always do,"" the hacker told me. Asked about his motivations, he said it was ""mainly just for the challenge [and] training my pentest skills."" He told me that he exploited a union-based SQL injection vulnerability in the site's software, a flaw he said was ""easy to find.""
The hacker provided the database to ZDNet for verification.
We verified a little over a dozen accounts by enumerating disposable email accounts with the site's password reset function. (We have more on how we verify breaches here.) In each case, the site validated the email address and was sent a new password (in plain text) to the disposable email account.
The hacker also provided the database to Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification site Have I Been Pwned.
Hunt's analysis of the database confirmed 637,340 unique email addresses in the database, with 62 percent of those email addresses already in his database.
While the hack of DaFont is far from the biggest data breach we've covered, it could still cause considerable headaches for a lot of people -- even if the free site didn't store any payment or other critically sensitive data. That's because this breach involves a huge trove of email addresses and passwords that could allow a hacker to break into other, more sensitive sites and services that share the same password.
In the case of corporate accounts, that could lead to further data breaches of sensitive and confidential business files. Among the confirmed email addresses we found in the breach, several accounts belonged to Microsoft, Google, and Apple corporate accounts.
Dozens of accounts were also associated with UK and US government agencies.
Several attempts to contact the site's registered owners prior to publication by phone and email were unsuccessful. In an email after we posted, a spokesperson said: ""We have been made aware of vulnerabilities and we are actively working to fix them. Some vulnerabilities had already been fixed before the ZDNet article. We have taken immediate measures to limit malicious access to user's accounts.""
Anyone thought to be affected by the breach can now search for their data in Have I Been Pwned.

"237","Bell","1,900,000","2017","Bell is apologizing to its customers after 1.9 million email addresses and approximately 1,700 names and phone numbers were stolen from a company database.
The information appears to have been posted online, but the company could not confirm the leaked data was one and the same.
Bell, the country's largest telecommunications company, attributed the incident to ""an anonymous hacker,"" and says it is working with the RCMP to investigate the breach.
""There is no indication that any financial, password or other sensitive personal information was accessed,"" the company wrote in a statement. Bell said the incident was unrelated to the massive spike in ransomware infections that affected an estimated 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries late last week.
It is not clear when the breach occurred, how the data was accessed, or how long the attacker had access to Bell's systems.
In 2014, the RCMP charged a Quebec youth after a Bell contractor was breached and 22,421 user names and passwords and five valid credit card numbers were posted online.
Attacker warns 'more will leak'
A person or group alleging to be behind the attack wrote in a post online that they were ""releasing a significant portion of Bell.ca's data due to the fact that they have failed to cooperate with us.""
""This shows how Bell doesn't care for its customers safety and they could have avoided this public announcement,"" the post continues. ""Bell, if you don't cooperate more will leak :)""
The post links to a set of files containing a long list of email addresses and related customer information that appear similar in size and substance to Bell's description of the stolen data — but also includes phone numbers, locations, job titles and other pieces of information about more than 150 supposed Bell contractors and employees.
When reached by phone, Bell's director of communications Marc Choma told CBC News that he couldn't comment on the incident or the apparent archive of leaked data because the investigation was continuing.
RCMP spokesperson Harold Pfleiderer responded in an email, ""Generally, only in the event that an investigation results in the laying of criminal charges, would the RCMP confirm its investigation, the nature of any charges laid and the identity of the individual(s) involved.""

"238","Zomato","17,000,000","2017","Since 2015 the Dark Web marketplaces have been flourishing. From drugs, weapons, databases, fake documents to all sorts of illegal stuff are available for anyone at anytime. Recently, HackRead found out a vendor going by the online handle of “nclay” is claiming to have hacked Zomato and selling the data of its 17 million registered users on a popular Dark Web marketplace.
The database includes emails and password hashes of registered Zomato users while the price set for the whole package is USD 1,001.43 (BTC 0.5587). The vendor also shared a trove of sample data to prove that the data is legit. Here’s a screenshot of the sample data publicly shared by “nclay.”
We tried to send a password reset email to some of the email addresses in the data which further revealed that they are registered with Zomato. Here’s a screenshot showing reset email successfully going to one of the users.
An email was also sent to Zomato from HackRead.com along with the sample data explaining about the incident. We also requested the company to confirm whether Zomato suffered a data breach or not. But, at the time of publishing this article, there was no response from the company.
It must be noted that Zomato already has an existing bug bounty program however the security researchers and hackers who report vulnerabilities only receive Hall of Fame recognition or a certificate of acknowledgment. Also, in 2015 Zomato was hacked by an Indian ethical hacker Anand Prakash, who not only discovered a critical security flaw in Zomato’s data recall system but also informed the company about the same.
Zomato is a world-renowned food and restaurant search engine giant founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah from India back in 2008. The site has over 90 million monthly visits and holds 945th rank in the world while it’s among the top 155 most visited sites in India according to Alexa ranking. Therefore, If there’s any truth in “nclay’s” claims which seemingly looks to be true, Zomato will have a busy week.
Currently, the same Dark Web marketplace where Zomato data is being sold also holds a number of vendors selling highly sensitive data stolen from tech and social media giants including anti-public combo list with billions of accounts, 100 million accounts from Chinese video service Youku, millions of accounts stolen from vBulletin forums, millions of Bitcoin forums data and millions of Gmail and Yahoo accounts with their plain-text passwords etc. 
Update: 
Although Zomato didn’t reply to our email but in their latest blog post the company has acknowledged the breach. This means that HackRead.com’s exclusive findings and hacker’s claim have turned out to be legit. Here’s a full preview of the blog post published by Zomato 7hours ago:
Over 120 million users visit Zomato every month. What binds all of these varied individuals is the desire to enjoy the best a city has to offer, in terms of food. When Zomato users trust us with their personal information, they naturally expect the information to be safeguarded. And that’s something we do diligently, without fail. We take cyber security very seriously – if you’ve been a regular at Zomato for years, you’d agree.
The reason you’re reading this blog post is because of a recent discovery by our security team – about 17 million user records from our database were stolen. The stolen information has user email addresses and hashed passwords.
We hash passwords with a one-way hashing algorithm, with multiple hashing iterations and individual salt per password. This means your password cannot be easily converted back to plain text. We, however, strongly advise you to change your password for any other services where you are using the same password.
Important note – payment related information on Zomato is stored separately from this (stolen) data in a highly secure PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) compliant vault. No payment information or credit card data has been stolen/leaked.
As a precaution, we have reset the passwords for all affected users and logged them out of the app and website. Our team is actively scanning all possible breach vectors and closing any gaps in our environment. So far, it looks like an internal (human) security breach – some employee’s development account got compromised.
How can this stolen information be misused?
Since we have reset the passwords for all affected users and logged them out of the app and website, your Zomato account is secure. Your credit card information on Zomato is fully secure, so there’s nothing to worry about there.

"239","Imgur","1,700,000","2017","On November 23, Imgur was notified of a potential security breach that occurred in 2014 that affected the email addresses and passwords of 1.7 million user accounts. While we are still actively investigating the intrusion, we wanted to inform you as quickly as possible as to what we know and what we are doing in response.
Timeline
On the afternoon of November 23rd, an email was sent to Imgur by a security researcher who frequently deals with data breaches. He believed he was sent data that included information of Imgur users. Our Chief Operating Officer received the email late night on November 23rd and immediately corresponded with the researcher to learn more about the potential breach. He simultaneously notified Imgur’s Founder/CEO and Vice President of Engineering. Our Vice President of Engineering then arranged to securely receive the data from the researcher and began working to validate that the data belonged to Imgur users.
What Information Was Involved?
Early morning on November 24th, we confirmed that approximately 1.7 million Imgur user accounts were compromised in 2014. The compromised account information included only email addresses and passwords. Imgur has never asked for real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personally-identifying information (“PII”), so the information that was compromised did NOT include such PII.
How Did This Happen?
We are still investigating how the account information was compromised. We have always encrypted your password in our database, but it may have been cracked with brute force due to an older hashing algorithm (SHA-256) that was used at the time. We updated our algorithm to the new bcrypt algorithm last year.
What Steps Are We Taking?
On the morning of November 24th, we began notifying impacted users via their registered email address. We are immediately requiring that these users update their password. We also published this public disclosure at 4PM PST.

The victim of the security breach is TIO Networks, a Canadian company that runs a network of over 60,000 utility and bills payment kiosks across North America. PayPal acquired TIO Networks this past July for $238 million in cash.
On November 10, PayPal suspended the operations of TIO's network. The company admitted that a security breach took place, but did not provide any other details.
In a press release published in a late Friday afternoon news dump, PayPal provided more details about the incident.
A review of TIO’s network has identified a potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million customers. The PayPal platform is not impacted in any way, as the TIO systems are completely separate from the PayPal network, and PayPal’s customers’ data remains secure.
PayPal says the intruder(s) got access to the personal information of both TIO customers and customers of TIO billers. The company did not reveal what type of information the attacker accessed, but since this is a payment system, attackers most likely obtained both personally-identifiable information (PII) and financial details.
As data breach laws impose, PayPal has now started notifying customers and is offering free credit monitoring memberships. TIO users can also visit the TIO Networks website for more details.

The leak includes postpaid and prepaid numbers, customer details, addresses as well as sim card information – including unique IMEI and IMSI numbers.
Time stamps on the files we downloaded indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014 between the various telcos. The exact numbers, broken down by telco/MVNO provider, and further broken down by prepaid or postpaid segments are as below.
We are also now fairly certain that the individual who tried to sell the data two weeks back acquired the data in a similar fashion that we did, and tried to make a quick profit by attempting to sell it on our Forums.
We have shared all details regarding the data that we uncovered, as well as how we managed to obtain all the data with the MCMC last week.
The MCMC is following up with the relevant agencies to determine the source of the breach, but we now believe that the data was already being traded online much earlier then we first estimated. Based on the condition of the files that we obtained, we are quite certain that it has already changed hands more than once.

Aside from the telco database, we can now also confirm that a total of 3 databases belonging to the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC), the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA), as well as the Malaysian Dental Association (MDA) have also been leaked.
As mentioned in our previous post, these medical databases include personal information, MyKad numbers, mobile/work/home phone numbers, as well as work and residential addresses.
Remedial Action
We first highlighted about this data breach on 19th October, and we are extremely concerned that no remedial action has been taken by the service providers involved to protect those that have been affected by the breach.
In this day where everything is stored electronically, data security breaches are not something to be taken lightly. Any entity, public or private, that stores proprietary or sensitive data electronically could end up having that data stolen or lost – with catastrophic consequences.
While it is the task of the authorities to narrow down the source of the breach, and ensure that a similar incident doesn’t happen again, the key to containing any more serious damage is protecting the individuals affected by the breach.
We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert and start immediately replacing the SIM cards of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014. While the leaked data alone isn’t sufficient to clone the SIM cards, the information available can be exploited to initiate multiple social engineering attacks against affected users.
Public awareness of the data breach, as well as vigilance are critical to keeping consumers safe after a data breach. The United States have enacted the Security Breach Notification Laws across 48 states that requires private or governmental entities to notify individuals of security breaches of information involving personally identifiable information – with California enacting it as early as 2002.

"243","Instagram","6,000,000","2017","A bug that exposed users’ contact information affected a far greater number of accounts than Instagram originally said. The bug, which appears to have been responsible for Selena Gomez’s account being hacked this week, allowed hackers to scrape email addresses and contact information for millions of accounts, Instagram said today. (It has since been fixed.) While the company first said the hack was limited to holders of verified accounts, it said today that non-verified users had been affected as well.
Hours after the hack was disclosed, hackers established a searchable database named Doxagram allowing users to search for victims’ contact information for $10 per search. The hacker provided a list of 1,000 accounts they said were available for searching on Doxagram to the Daily Beast, and the list included most of the 50 most-followed accounts on the service. Instagram still will not say how many accounts were affected, other than that it is a “low percentage of Instagram accounts.” There are more than 700 million active Instagram accounts; hackers say they have information on file for 6 million users. Users’ passwords were not exposed in the hack, Instagram said.
As of 5:50 p.m. Friday, Doxagram was offline. It was unclear how or when it might come back. Instagram would not comment on whether it had sought to have the site shut down.
But even with the site shut down, contact information for dozens of celebrities now appears to be floating around on the dark web. A cybersecurity firm named RepKnight said it found what purported to be contact information for celebrities including:
Actors: Emma Watson, Emilia Clarke, Zac Efron, Leonardo DiCaprio, Channing Tatum.
Musicians: Harry Styles, Ellie Goulding, Victoria Beckham, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Adele, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears.
Athletes: Floyd Mayweather, Zinedine Zidane, Neymar, David Beckham, Ronaldinho.
For celebrities and other high-profile users, the hack could mean having to change a phone number, email address, or both. But it can also be used along with social engineering techniques to gain access to the account itself. That seems to be what happened to Gomez, Instagram’s most-followed user. Her account was briefly taken down Monday after it was used to post nude photographs of Justin Bieber, her ex-boyfriend.
Today’s news is troubling on at least two fronts. One, average Instagram users may be at risk of hacking. Two, Instagram says it does not know which accounts were affected. “After additional analysis, we have determined that this issue potentially impacted some non-verified accounts as well,” Instagram co-founder and chief technical officer Mike Krieger said in a blog post. “Although we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted, we believe it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts.”
The company also said it is “working with law enforcement” to combat the sale of stolen information. “We encourage people to be vigilant about the security of their account and exercise caution if they encounter any suspicious activity such as unrecognized incoming calls, texts and emails,” Krieger said. “The safety and security of our community are important to us, and we are very sorry this happened.”

"244","Viacom","3,000,000","2017","Viacom—the popular entertainment and media company that owns Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, MTV, and hundreds of other properties—has exposed the keys to its kingdom on an unsecured Amazon S3 server.
A security researcher working for California-based cyber resiliency firm UpGuard has recently discovered a wide-open, public-facing misconfigured Amazon Web Server S3 cloud storage bucket containing roughly a gigabyte's worth of credentials and configuration files for the backend of dozens of Viacom properties.
These exposed credentials discovered by UpGuard researcher Chris Vickery would have been enough for hackers to take down Viacom's internal IT infrastructure and internet presence, allowing them to access cloud servers belonging to MTV, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon.
Among the data exposed in the leak was Viacom's master key to its Amazon Web Services account, and the credentials required to build and maintain Viacom servers across its many subsidiaries and dozens of brands.
""Perhaps most damaging among the exposed data are Viacom's secret cloud keys, an exposure that, in the most damaging circumstances, could put the international media conglomerate's cloud-based servers in the hands of hackers,"" an UpGuard blog post says. 
""Such a scenario could enable malicious actors to launch a host of damaging attacks, using the IT infrastructure of one of the world's largest broadcast and media companies.""
In other words, the access key and secret key for the company's AWS account would have allowed hackers to compromise Viacom's servers, storage, and databases under the AWS account.
ccording to the analysis performed by UpGuard, a number of cloud instances used within the media company's IT toolchain, including Docker, Splunk, New Relic, and Jenkins, could have ""thus been compromised in this manner.""
In addition to these damaging leaks, the unprotected server also contained GPG decryption keys, which can be used to unlock sensitive data. However, the server did not contain any customer or employee information.
Although it is unclear whether hackers were able to exploit this information to access important files belonging to Viacom and the firms it owns, the media giant said there's no evidence anyone had abused its data.
""We have analyzed the data in question and determined there was no material impact,"" the company said in a statement.
""Once Viacom became aware that information on a server—including technical information, but no employee or customer information—was publicly accessible, we rectified the issue.""
All the credentials have now been changed after UpGuard contacted Viacom executives privately, and the server was secured shortly afterwards.
This is not the first time when Vickery has discovered a company's sensitive information stored on an unprotected AWS C3 server.
Vickery has previously tracked down many exposed datasets on the Internet, including personal details of over 14 million Verizon customers, a cache of 60,000 documents from a US military, information of over 191 Million US voter records, and 13 Million MacKeeper users.

Here are the facts, according to Equifax. The breach lasted from mid-May through July. The hackers accessed people’s names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. They also stole credit card numbers for about 209,000 people and dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 people. And they grabbed personal information of people in the UK and Canada too.

Here are some other steps to take to help protect yourself after a data breach:
Check your credit reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — for free — by visiting annualcreditreport.com. Accounts or activity that you don’t recognize could indicate identity theft. Visit IdentityTheft.gov to find out what to do.
Consider placing a credit freeze on your files. A credit freeze makes it harder for someone to open a new account in your name. Keep in mind that a credit freeze won’t prevent a thief from making charges to your existing accounts.
Monitor your existing credit card and bank accounts closely for charges you don’t recognize.
If you decide against a credit freeze, consider placing a fraud alert on your files. A fraud alert warns creditors that you may be an identity theft victim and that they should verify that anyone seeking credit in your name really is you.
File your taxes early — as soon as you have the tax information you need, before a scammer can. Tax identity theft happens when someone uses your Social Security number to get a tax refund or a job. Respond right away to letters from the IRS.

"246","SVR Tracking","540,000","2017","Another day, another news about a data breach, though this is something disconcerting.
Login credentials of more than half a million records belonging to vehicle tracking device company SVR Tracking have leaked online, potentially exposing the personal data and vehicle details of drivers and businesses using its service.
Just two days ago, Viacom was found exposing the keys to its kingdom on an unsecured Amazon S3 server, and this data breach is yet another example of storing sensitive data on a misconfigured cloud server.
The Kromtech Security Center was first to discover a wide-open, public-facing misconfigured Amazon Web Server (AWS) S3 cloud storage bucket containing a cache belonging to SVR that was left publicly accessible for an unknown period.
Stands for Stolen Vehicle Records, the SVR Tracking service allows its customers to track their vehicles in real time by attaching a physical tracking device to vehicles in a discreet location, so their customers can monitor and recover them in case their vehicles are stolen.
The leaked cache contained details of roughly 540,000 SVR accounts, including email addresses and passwords, as well as users' vehicle data, like VIN (vehicle identification number), IMEI numbers of GPS devices.
Since the leaked passwords were stored using SHA-1, a 20-years-old weak cryptographic hash function that was designed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which can be cracked with ease.
The leaked database also exposed 339 logs that contained photographs and data about vehicle status and maintenance records, along with a document with information on the 427 dealerships that use SVR's tracking services.
 
Interestingly, the exposed database also contained information where exactly in the car the physical tracking unit was hidden.
According to Kromtech, the total number of devices exposed ""could be much larger given the fact that many of the resellers or clients had large numbers of devices for tracking.""
Since SVR's car tracking device monitors a vehicle everywhere for the past 120 days, anyone with access to SVR users' login credentials could both track a vehicle in real time and create a detailed log of every location the vehicle has visited using any internet connected device like a desktop, laptop, mobile phone or tablet.
Eventually, the attacker could outright steal the vehicle or even rob a home when they know a car's owner is out.
Kromtech responsible alerted the company of the misconfigured AWS S3 cloud storage bucket, which has since been secured. However, It is unclear whether the publically accessible data was possibly accessed by hackers or not.

"247","Click2Gov","300,000","2018","Paying parking tickets or municipal water taxes is never fun—and it’s even worse when hackers have compromised your town’s payment system. Yet, that’s what happened in dozens of towns across the U.S. where cyber crooks have made off with the personal data of nearly 300,000 people.
Security research firm Gemini Advisory published a report Tuesday that provides new details on how vulnerabilities in Click2Gov, a widely used type of government payment software, has affected towns from Oceanside, Calif. to Sarasota, Fla.
The vulnerability has let hackers get onto the payment networks and steal credit card and debit card data when citizens use town websites to pay fines, taxes, and permits.
Reports of vulnerabilities in Click2Gov first surfaced in 2017 and, in September, cyber security giant FireEye confirmed the attacks were a nationwide problem.
The new Gemini report provides additional details about the extent of the hacks, and what the crooks are doing with the data. According to the firm, at least 294,929 payment records have been compromised in 46 U.S. cities, while criminals have earned $1.7 million selling the data on the dark web—typically for $10 per record.
Gemini’s Director of Research, Stas Alforov, told Fortune that Click2Gov has worked with many of the affected towns to patch the software, and that the breaches have arisen in part because of a lack of sophistication on the part of municipal IT workers.
The company that licenses the Click2Gov software, known as CentralSquare Technologies, did not immediately respond to a request for comments about the breach.
For the citizens using Click2Gov to honor their civic obligations, the breaches will not likely result in a financial loss since banks and credit card companies typically foot the bill in the case of stolen data. But the incidents do mean all of the aggravations that go with identity theft, including the need to replace their cards and possible damage to their credit scores.
Gemini’s Alforov says that many of the towns have addressed the Click2Gov vulnerabilities, but others have not, meaning the data exfiltration is ongoing.
Alforov added that the hackers behind the breaches do not appear to be particularly sophisticated, but that they have nonetheless figured out how to profit from the weak security of local governments.
Gemini was able to identify the affected municipalities by examining the addresses related to the stolen cards. Other affected towns include Laredo, Texas, Topeko, Kans. and Medford, Ore. ","financial","3",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Poor_Security_Practices"
"248","SingHealth","1,500,000","2018","In the light of the attack, all of Singapore's Smart Nation plans, including the mandatory contribution to the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) project - which enables the sharing of patients' treatment and medical data among hospitals here - have been paused.
Specifically, mandatory contribution to NEHR is now on hold until further notice.
Mr Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-Charge of Cyber Security, will convene a Committee of Inquiry (COI) to conduct an independent external review of the incident. Retired district judge Richard Magnus will chair the committee.
Initial investigations showed that one SingHealth front-end workstation was infected with malware through which the hackers gained access to the data base. The data theft happened between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018.
SingHealth has imposed a temporary Internet surfing separation on all of its 28,000 staff's work computers. Other public healthcare institutions will do the same.
Unusual activity was first detected on July 4 on one of SingHealth's IT databases. Security measures, including the blocking of dubious connections and changing of passwords, were taken to thwart the hackers.
On July 10, the Health Ministry, SingHealth and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore were informed after forensic investigations confirmed that it was a cyber attack. A police report was made on July 12.
No further data has been stolen since July 4.
All patient records in SingHealth's IT system remain intact and there has been no disruption of healthcare services.
SingHealth will be contacting all patients who visited its specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinics from May 1, 2015, to July 4, 2018, to notify them if their data has been stolen. An SMS message will be sent to all patients over the next five days.
Patients can also access the Health Buddy mobile app and SingHealth website to check if they are affected by the breach. They can also check using this link.
Mr Iswaran said that “we must get to the bottom of this breach”.
“We must not let this derail our Smart Nation services... it is the way of the future,” he said, taking a longer-term view of the projects.
Even though a thorough review of Smart Nation projects will be conducted, he stressed that Singapore has paused but not halted these projects.
The Ministry of Health has directed a thorough review of the public healthcare system to improve cyber security, and all public and private healthcare institutions have been advised to take cyber-security precautions.

"249","GovPayNow.com","14,000,000","2018","Government Payment Service Inc. — a company used by thousands of U.S. state and local governments to accept online payments for everything from traffic citations and licensing fees to bail payments and court-ordered fines — has leaked more than 14 million customer records dating back at least six years, including names, addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of the payer’s credit card.
Indianapolis-based GovPayNet, doing business online as GovPayNow.com, serves approximately 2,300 government agencies in 35 states. GovPayNow.com displays an online receipt when citizens use it to settle state and local government fees and fines via the site. Until this past weekend it was possible to view millions of customer records simply by altering digits in the Web address displayed by each receipt.
On Friday, Sept. 14, KrebsOnSecurity alerted GovPayNet that its site was exposing at least 14 million customer receipts dating back to 2012. Two days later, the company said it had addressed “a potential issue.”
“GovPayNet has addressed a potential issue with our online system that allows users to access copies of their receipts, but did not adequately restrict access only to authorized recipients,” the company said in a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity.
The statement continues:
“The company has no indication that any improperly accessed information was used to harm any customer, and receipts do not contain information that can be used to initiate a financial transaction. Additionally, most information in the receipts is a matter of public record that may be accessed through other means. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution and to maximize security for users, GovPayNet has updated this system to ensure that only authorized users will be able to view their individual receipts. We will continue to evaluate security and access to all systems and customer records.”
In January 2018, GovPayNet was acquired by Securus Technologies, a Carrollton, Texas- based company that provides telecommunications services to prisons and helps law enforcement personnel keep tabs on mobile devices used by former inmates.
Although its name may suggest otherwise, Securus does not have a great track record in securing data. In May 2018, the New York Times broke the news that Securus’ service for tracking the cell phones of convicted felons was being abused by law enforcement agencies to track the real-time location of mobile devices used by people who had only been suspected of committing a crime. The story observed that authorities could use the service to track the real-time location of nearly any mobile phone in North America.
Just weeks later, Motherboard reported that hackers had broken into Securus’ systems and stolen the online credentials for multiple law enforcement officials who used the company’s systems to track the location of suspects via their mobile phone number.
A story here on May 22 illustrated how Securus’ site appeared to allow anyone to reset the password of an authorized Securus user simply by guessing the answer to one of three pre-selected “security questions,” including “what is your pet name,” “what is your favorite color,” and “what town were you born in”. Much like GovPayNet, the Securus Web site seemed to have been erected sometime in the aughts and left to age ungracefully for years.
Data exposures like these are some of the most common but easily preventable forms of information leaks online. In this case, it was trivial to enumerate how many records were exposed because each record was sequential.
E-commerce sites can mitigate such leaks by using something other than easily-guessed or sequential record numbers, and/or encrypting unique portions of the URL displayed to customers upon payment.
Although fixing these information disclosure vulnerabilities is quite simple, it’s remarkable how many organizations that should know better don’t invest the resources needed to find and fix them. In August, KrebsOnSecurity disclosed a similar flaw at work across hundreds of small bank Web sites run by Fiserv, a major provider of technology services to financial institutions.
In July, identity theft protection service LifeLock fixed an information disclosure flaw that needlessly exposed the email address of millions of subscribers. And in April 2018, PaneraBread.com remedied a weakness that exposed millions of customer names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and partial credit card numbers.

Hong Kong's flagship carrier said it had discovered unauthorised access to the personal data but had no evidence the leaked information had been misused.
Data breach documents from Hong Kong Exchanges — which operates the Hong Kong Stock Exchange — noted on Wednesday that Cathay Pacific first discovered suspicious activity on its network in March.
The documents state ""unauthorised access to certain personal data was confirmed in early May 2018"".
The airline noted in a statement on Wednesday that the breach was discovered during ""ongoing security processes"".
Cathay Pacific said the stolen data included names, nationalities, birth dates, phone numbers, addresses, passport and identity card numbers and expired credit card numbers, among other information.
It noted 403 expired credit card numbers were accessed, and 27 credit card numbers with no CVV were accessed.
The company said no passwords were compromised.
Privacy commissioner orders investigation
Hong Kong's privacy commissioner, Stephen Kai-yi Wong, expressed ""serious concern"" over the lapse and urged companies to improve protection of personal data.
He said his office would begin a compliance check of the airline.
He urged people to change their passwords and enable ""two-factor authentication"" to help protect their data.
Shares in the company dropped to a nine-year low during trade but clawed back some losses to close down 3.77 per cent.
The company said it was contacting customers to advise them on how to protect themselves.
""We acted immediately to contain the event, commence a thorough investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm, and to further strengthen our IT security measures,"" the airline's chief executive officer Rupert Hogg said in a statement.
""We are very sorry for any concern this data security event may cause our passengers,"" he said.
In September, British Airways revealed similar hacking that exposed hundreds of thousands of customers, and Delta Airlines in the US said in April that several hundred thousand customers could have been exposed by a malware breach months earlier.

Upon closer inspection, an 854 GB sized MongoDB database was left unattended, with no password/login authentication needed to view and access the details of what appeared to be more than 200 million very detailed resumes of Chinese job seekers.
Each of the 202,730,434 records contained the details not only on the candidates’ skills and work experience but also on their personal info, such as mobile phone number, email, marriage, children, politics, height, weight, driver license, literacy level, salary expectations and more.
The origin of the data remained unknown until one of my Twitter followers pointed to a GitHub repository (page is no longer available but it is still saved in Google cache) which contained a web app source code with identical structural patterns as those used in the exposed resumes:
The tool named “data-import” (created 3 years ago) seems to have been created to scrape data (resumes) from different Chinese classifieds, like bj.58.com and others.
It is unknown, whether it was an official application or illegal one used to collect all the applicants’ details, even those labeled as ‘private’.
Upon additional request, the security team of BJ.58.com did not confirm that the data originated from their source:
We have searched all over the database of us and investigated all the other storage, turned out that the sample data is not leaked from us.
It seems that the data is leaked from a third party who scrape data from many CV websites.
Shortly after my notification on Twitter, the database had been secured. It’s worth noting that MongoDB log showed at least a dozen IPs who might have accessed the data before it was taken offline.
As of the date of this publication, there is no official confirmation on the data owner.

"252","WordPress","76,500,000","2018","A week after releasing its first major update in quite some time, the WordPress team has pushed the first security patch for its brand new WordPress 5.0 branch.
Released hours ago, WordPress version 5.0.1 fixes seven security vulnerabilities (some of which allow site takeover) but also plugs a pretty serious privacy leak.
Also: A botnet of over 20,000 WordPress sites is attacking other WordPress sites
The latter was found by the authors of the popular Yoast SEO plugin, who discovered that in some cases the activation screen for new users could end up being indexed by Google.
With specially crafted Google searches, an attacker could find these pages and collect users' email addresses, and in some rare cases, default-generated passwords.
This leak could have catastrophic consequences if the user has an admin role or if the user didn't change his default password, as is regularly advised.
On top of this, WordPress 5.0.1 also adds support for a stronger MIME validation process for uploaded files.
""Prior to 5.0.1, WordPress did not require uploaded files to pass MIME type verification, so files could be uploaded even if the contents didn't match the file extension. For example, a binary file could be uploaded with a .jpg extension,"" said Ian Dunn, a WordPress CMS developer.
""This is no longer the case, and the content of uploaded files must now match their extension. Most valid files should be unaffected, but there may be cases when a file needs to be renamed to its correct extension (e.g., an OpenOffice doc going from .pptx to .ppxs),"" Dunn said.
The WordPress team improved its MIME validation process after two security researchers, Tim Coen and Slavco, discovered that authors on Apache-hosted sites could upload specifically crafted files that bypass MIME verification, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
On top of this, Coen also discovered that WordPress users could edit new comments from higher-privileged users, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, and that specially crafted URL inputs could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in some circumstances. In this latter case, the WordPress CMS itself was not affected, but Coen said WordPress plugins could be impacted in some scenarios.
But the biggest of the seven security flaws reported to the WordPress team and fixed in v5.0.1 is an issue found by Sam Thomas from Secarma Labs, about which ZDNet wrote this past August --more details here-- and which can lead to full site takeovers.
On top of this, the WordPress team also fixed two bugs reported by RIPS Technologies. One bug could allow authors to alter meta data to delete files that they weren't authorized to, and the second allowed authors to create unauthorized posts.
Today's fixes have also been ported to the older 4.x branch, users of which received version 4.9.9 to address the reported problems.

"253","Google+","52,500,000","2018","Google+ has suffered another data leak, and Google has decided to shut down the consumer version of the social network four months earlier than it originally planned. Google+ will now close to consumers in April, rather than August. Additionally, API access to the network will shut down within the next 90 days.
According to Google, the new vulnerability impacted 52.5 million users, who could have had profile information like their name, email address, occupation, and age exposed to developers, even if their account was set to private. Apps could also access profile data that had been shared with a specific user, but was not shared publicly.
In October, a similar Google+ vulnerability was revealed to have exposed private user data to developers for as long as three years. The bug was first discovered in March, but not publicly disclosed until October, resulting in significant transparency concerns. In response, Google announced plans to shut down the consumer version of Google+, which had long struggled to attract users. This time around, Google says it discovered the leak on its own and it was live for just six days — between November 7th and November 13th.
“With the discovery of this new bug, we have decided to expedite the shut-down of all Google+ APIs; this will occur within the next 90 days,” reads the blog post, penned by David Thacker, Google’s vice president of project management. “In addition, we have also decided to accelerate the sunsetting of consumer Google+ from August 2019 to April 2019. While we recognize there are implications for developers, we want to ensure the protection of our users.”
Google discovered the bug as part of its standard testing procedure and says there is “no evidence that the app developers that inadvertently had this access for six days were aware of it or misused.” Google says it’s begun notifying users and enterprise customers who were impacted by the bug.
“We understand that our ability to build reliable products that protect your data drives user trust,” Thacker wrote. “We have always taken this seriously, and we continue to invest in our privacy programs.” Google still plans to continue operating Google+ as an enterprise product for companies that subscribe to its G Suite service.

Nearly 2,000 people have so far lodged a complaint against the leak, which was caused, the NMBS said, by a data worker “clicking on the wrong button”.
Commission chairman Willem Debeuckelaere said that the explanation given by the NMBS “sounds plausible. But we will be examining this version, as well as a report commissioned from a consultancy by the NMBS, more closely, to see if this version of events is correct.”
Whether by accident or not, the commission has stated that the NMBS is responsible for breach of privacy of the customers aff ected – an estimated 700,000 people – including names, addresses and email addresses. The data, which were open for consultation on an unsecured server, were later copied by someone and placed on another site.
The commission will now file a report with the federal prosecutor, who must decide whether to take legal action and against whom. One of the copies was used by the site www.sncb.fredericjacobs.com to allow members of the public to check if their own details were part of the package leaked onto the net. The NMBS said the site was not an official initiative and stressed that any dissemination of private information was illegal.
Meanwhile, the ministry of defence was investigating another data leak, this time of an internal directory of about 500 staff at the ministry, giving names, functions and contact details. The leak was revealed by a blogger, who said he had been able to download the 37-page document simply via Google.

"255","Facebook","50,000,000","2018","The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.
The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.
However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.
Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.
“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”
On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.
The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.
The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.
Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.
Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”
Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”
Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.
At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.
The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.
That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.
“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.
Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.
“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”
Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.
“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”
A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.
Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.
Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.
Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.

The data available in plain text from Panera’s site appeared to include records for any customer who has signed up for an account to order food online via panerabread.com. The St. Louis-based company, which has more than 2,100 retail locations in the United States and Canada, allows customers to order food online for pickup in stores or for delivery.
KrebsOnSecurity learned about the breach earlier today after being contacted by security researcher Dylan Houlihan, who said he initially notified Panera about customer data leaking from its Web site back on August 2, 2017.
A long message thread that Houlihan shared between himself and Panera indicates that Mike Gustavison, Panera’s director of information security, initially dismissed Houlihan’s report as a likely scam. A week later, however, those messages suggest that the company had validated Houlihan’s findings and was working on a fix.
Fast forward to early this afternoon — exactly eight months to the day after Houlihan first reported the problem — and data shared by Houlihan indicated the site was still leaking customer records in plain text. Worse still, the records could be indexed and crawled by automated tools with very little effort.
For example, some of the customer records include unique identifiers that increment by one for each new record, making it potentially simple for someone to scrape all available customer accounts. The format of the database also lets anyone search for customers via a variety of data points, including by phone number.
“Panera Bread uses sequential integers for account IDs, which means that if your goal is to gather as much information as you can instead about someone, you can simply increment through the accounts and collect as much as you’d like, up to and including the entire database,” Houlihan said.
Asked whether he saw any indication that Panera ever addressed the issue he reported in August 2017 until today, Houlihan said no.
“No, the flaw never disappeared,” he said. “I checked on it every month or so because I was pissed.”
Shortly after KrebsOnSecurity spoke briefly with Panera’s chief information officer John Meister by phone today, the company briefly took the Web site offline. As of this publication, the site is back online but the data referenced above no longer appears to be reachable.
Another data point exposed in these records included the customer’s Panera loyalty card number, which could potentially be abused by scammers to spend prepaid accounts or to otherwise siphon value from Panera customer loyalty accounts.
It is not clear yet exactly how many Panera customer records may have been exposed by the company’s leaky Web site, but incremental customer numbers indexed by the site suggest that number may be higher than seven million. It’s also unclear whether any Panera customer account passwords may have been impacted.
In a written statement, Panera said it had fixed the problem within less than two hours of being notified by KrebsOnSecurity. But Panera did not explain why it appears to have taken the company eight months to fix the issue after initially acknowledging it privately with Houlihan.
“Panera takes data security very seriously and this issue is resolved,” the statement reads. “Following reports today of a potential problem on our website, we suspended the functionality to repair the issue.  Our investigation is continuing, but there is no evidence of payment card information nor a large number of records being accessed or retrieved.”

"257","Aadhaar","1,000,000,000","2018","The personal information of more than a billion Indians stored in the world’s largest biometric database can be bought online for less than £6, according to an investigation by an Indian newspaper.
The reported breach is the latest in a series of alleged leaks from the Aadhaar database, which has been collecting the photographs, thumbprints, retina scans and other identifying details of every Indian citizen.
The report in the Chandigarh-based Tribune newspaper claimed that software is also being sold online that can generate fake Aadhaar cards, an identity document that is required to access a growing number of government services including free meals and subsidised grain.
The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which administers the Aadhaar system, said it appeared the newspaper had accessed only limited details through a search facility that had been made available to government officials.
It said it would seek to press charges against those who had “misused” the system, but stressed that no thumbprints or retina scans had been made available. “Mere display of demographic information cannot be misused without biometrics,” it said in a statement. “Claims of bypassing or duping the Aadhaar enrolment system are totally unfounded. Aadhaar data is fully safe and secure and has robust, uncompromised security.”
The newspaper report said anonymous people in WhatsApp groups were charging 500 rupees (£5.82) for the details of an account that allowed access to information from the Aadhaar database. This included a person’s name, home and email addresses, photographs and phone numbers.
The newspaper claimed that it purchased a code and was able to gain access to the information, as well as to the software that permits users to print fake Aadhaar cards. The Guardian could not independently verify the report.
More than 200 government websites were revealed in November to have published the Aadhaar numbers of citizens along with the names, addresses and bank details. UIDAI said that in that case the information had been inadvertently published by other government departments and was removed as soon as the breach became apparent.
Aadhaar workers have spent the past four years traversing India taking the names and photographs and scanning the eyeballs and thumbs of more than a billion people. The government says the database will bring vast numbers of Indians into the digital economy, allowing direct access to social programmes in a country where one study has estimated 84% of welfare funds are lost to intermediaries.
But critics argue that the benefits of Aadhaar are overblown and that such an enormous and potentially lucrative database can never be fully secured.
Activists also blame glitches in the rollout of the scheme for the death by starvation of at least two people who were unable to access rations, a welfare programme that now requires Aadhaar authentication.
In August, the supreme court ruled that privacy was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian constitution, a decision legal analysts predict could leave parts of the Aadhaar programme vulnerable to legal challenge.

"258","Careem","14,000,000","2018","Cyber criminals have stolen the personal data of more than 14 million customers of the popular Dubai-born, ride-hailing service Careem.
 
In a blog post on Careem's website on Monday, it said on January 14 it ""identified a cyber incident involving unauthorised access to the system we use to store data"".  
 
In a separate statement to Khaleej Times, a company spokesperson said it could not share how many people were affected in the UAE as it ""does not disclose market data"" here, but it did share an overall figure.
 
""20 million customers have signed up across our platform. We are currently in 14 countries and close to 100 cities. 14 million of these customers were affected by the incident.""
 
On January 14, Careem said it ""became aware"" that online criminals gained access to its computer systems which hold customer and captain (drivers) account data.
 
Although the blog stated there is ""no evidence"" that password or credit card numbers have been compromised, it did state that the online criminals hacked personal information including customers' name, email address, phone number and trip data.
 
""A PCP server uses highly secure protocols and is employed by international banks around the globe to protect financial information,"" the blog read.
 
However, it did reiterate that customers and captains who signed up with the service after January 14 will not have been affected by the data hack.
 
Careem stated that as soon as it detected the breach, a thorough investigation was launched which engaged leading cybersecurity experts to assist in strengthening its security systems.
 
""We are also working with law enforcement agencies. Since discovering the issue, we have worked to understand what happened, who was affected, and what we needed to do to strengthen our network defences.""
While Careem said it has ""seen no evidence of fraud or misuse related to this incident"", it said its main responsibility was to be open and honest with customers in order to reaffirm its commitment to protecting their privacy and data.
Moving forward, Careem said it understands the importance of customer privacy and it regularly reviews and updates its security systems, thought ""this time it wasn't enough to prevent an attack"".
""While no organisation is completely immune to the threat of cybercrime, we are committed to meeting these threats and protecting the privacy and data of those that have placed their trust in us. We apologise for what has happened but rest assured, Careem has learned from this experience and will come out of it a stronger and more resilient organisation.""

"259","Texas voter records","14,800,000","2018","The data — a single file containing an estimated 14.8 million records — was left on an unsecured server without a password. Texas has 19.3 million registered voters.
It’s the latest exposure of voter data in a long string of security incidents that have cast doubt on political parties’ abilities to keep voter data safe at a time where nation states are actively trying to influence elections.
TechCrunch obtained a copy of the file, which was first found by a New Zealand-based data breach hunter who goes by the pseudonym Flash Gordon. It’s not clear who owned the server where the exposed file was found, but an analysis of the data reveals that it was likely originally compiled by Data Trust, a Republican-focused data analytics firm created by the GOP to provide campaigns with voter data.
Chris Vickery, director of cyber risk research at security firm UpGuard, analyzed a portion of the data. (It was Vickery who found a larger trove of 198 million voter records last year exposed by a similar data firm Deep Root Analytics, which sourced much of its data from Data Trust.)
A spokesperson for Data Trust declined to comment on the record, but later gave a statement to the Austin American-Statesman denying a breach of its systems.
The file — close to 16 gigabytes in size — contained dozens of fields, including personal information like a voter’s name, address, gender and several years’ worth of voting history, including primaries and presidential elections.
Granted, much of that data is public. According to The Texas Tribune, that kind of voter data in Texas is already obtainable for a fee, but information relating to individuals’ political affiliations and party memberships is not. Sam Taylor, communications director for the Texas secretary of state, told TechCrunch said that Social Security numbers are excluded, and the voter data cannot be used for commercial purposes, like advertising.
Taylor added that the data exposure was not related to Texas’ statewide voter registration database.
“The Texas Secretary of State’s office takes the integrity and security of Texans’ voter data very seriously, and have received no indication or evidence that our state’s voter registration database has been exposed, infiltrated, breached, or otherwise compromised,” he said.
“The private entity or individual that reportedly exposed the data in their possession will have to answer questions as to why they allowed such an exposure to occur,” he added.
But data-driven political firms like Data Trust use this kind of voter data for political purposes, specializing in supplementing those voter profiles with information that might help a campaign to flip a person who might not vote for a Republican candidate at the ballot box.
That’s where this file fills in the gaps with dozens of other fields, which can be used by campaigns to position their political messaging.
For example, the data includes fields that might score an individual’s believed views on immigration, hunting, abortion rights, government spending and views on the Second Amendment.
Other fields were more relevant to the recent 2016 presidential election, in which the data predictively scored individuals on if they “trust” or have “no trust” for then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The data also includes additional personal information, such as a person’s phone numbers and their ethnicity and race.
It’s not known exactly when the data was compiled, but an analysis of the data suggests it was prepared in time for the 2016 presidential election. It’s also not known if the file is a subset of the 198 million records leak last year — or if it’s a standalone data set.
Without an owner to inform of the exposure, it’s unclear if the data is still online.

"260","British Airways","380,000","2018","British Airways is investigating the theft of customer data from its website and app over a two-week period and has urged customers affected to contact their banks or credit card providers.
The airline said around 380,000 payment cards had been compromised and it had notified the police.
In a statement it said: ""The stolen data did not include travel or passport details. From 22.58 BST August 21 2018 until 21.45 BST September 5 2018 inclusive, the personal and financial details of customers making bookings on ba.com and the airline's app were compromised. The breach has been resolved and our website is working normally.
""British Airways is communicating with affected customers and we advise any customers who believe they may have been affected by this incident to contact their banks or credit card providers and follow their recommended advice.
""We have notified the police and relevant authorities.""
The data theft, one of the most serious to hit a UK company, deals another blow to BA’s reputation. In May last year, the airline suffered an IT disaster when a power surge in its control centre near Heathrow caused a global flight interruption and left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, most notably at the London airports. Smaller glitches have recurred, with dozens of short-haul flights cancelled again this July.
Although BA and the airline group that owns it, IAG, have denied the issues were connected to a decision to outsource IT operations, the latest breach will raise further questions.
The National Crime Agency said: “We are aware of reports of a data breach affecting British Airways and are working with partners to assess the best course of action.”
A spokesman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said it would be making inquiries about the data theft.
Alex Neill of Which? said: “British Airways customers will be concerned to hear about this data breach. It is now vital that the company moves quickly to ensure those affected get clear information about what has happened and what steps they should take to protect themselves.
“Anyone concerned they could be at risk of fraud should consider changing their online passwords, monitor bank and other online accounts and be wary of emails regarding the breach as scammers may try and take advantage of it.”
BA could also potentially face swingeing fines should it be found negligent, under new general data protection regulations. The rules now in force could see a drastic escalation in the penalties slapped on firms for past data breaches, with fines levied at a maximum of 4% of global revenues – which in BA’s case spells an upper limit of £500m.
Rob Burgess, editor of UK frequent flyer website www.headforpoints.com, said: “Data breaches are part and parcel of the world we now live in, and criminal activity is getting ever more sophisticated. Unfortunately, this is likely to be another PR disaster for British Airways, especially as it includes tickets bought in their September sale which is being widely promoted at the moment.”

"261","T-Mobile","2,000,000","2018","After this story was first published, a T-Mobile spokesperson told me that “encrypted passwords” were included in the compromised data. In its original announcement, the company said: “no passwords were compromised.”
When I asked why the company used that wording, the spokesperson said in a message: “Because they weren’t [compromised]. They were encrypted.”
The spokesperson declined to specify how those passwords were encrypted, or what hashing algorithm was used. Hours after this story was published, security researcher Nicholas Ceraolo reached out claiming that the data exposed in the breach was more than what T-Mobile disclosed. The researcher shared a sample of allegedly compromised data that included a field called “userpassword” and what looks like a hash, which is a cryptographic representations of a password. (Ceraolo said he was not involved in the hack but obtained the sample from a ""mutual friend."")
According to two different security researchers, with whom Motherboard shared that hash, it may be an encoded string hashed with the notoriously weak algorithm called MD5, which can potentially be cracked with brute-forcing attacks.
Jeremi M. Gosney, a well-known password expert and CEO of the password-cracking firm Terahash,
analyzed the hash for Motherboard. Gosney said that while the hash algorithm is not totally clear, algorithm could likely be reverse engineered with access to a larger sample of hashes from the database.
Customers should assume their passwords have already been cracked and should change it, he told me in an online chat.
On late Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that hackers stole some of the personal data of 2 million people in a new data breach.
In a brief intrusion, hackers stole ""some"" customer data including names, email addresses, account numbers, and other billing information. The good news is that they did not get credit card numbers, social security numbers, according to the company.
In its announcement, T-Mobile said that its cybersecurity team detected an “unauthorized capture of some information” on Monday, Aug. 20.
“Our cyber-security team discovered and shut down an unauthorized access to certain information, including yours, and we promptly reported it to authorities. None of your financial data (including credit card information) or social security numbers were involved, and no passwords were compromised” the announcement published on the company’s website read. “However, you should know that some of your personal information may have been exposed, which may have included one or more of the following: name, billing zip code, phone number, email address, account number and account type (prepaid or postpaid).”
A company spokesperson told me that the breach affected “about” or “slightly less than” 3% of its 77 million customers.
“Fortunately not many,” the spokesperson said in a text message, adding she could not disclose the exact number.
The spokesperson added that the “incident” happened “early in the morning on Aug. 20,” when hackers part of “an international group” accessed company servers through an API that “didn’t contain any financial data or other very sensitive data.”
According to the spokesperson, on the same day of the intrusion, the cybersecurity team detected it.
“We found it quickly and shut it down very fast,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said she couldn’t give “specifics” of the attack and did not know whether the hackers were criminals or part of a government.
T-Mobile is reaching out to victims directly via text message to notify them, she said.
The company wrote in the announcement that “all affected customers have been, or shortly will be, notified. If you don’t receive a notification than that means your account was not among those impacted by this incident.” T-Mobile also encouraged customers to contact customer service through 611 if they were concerned.
This is the latest in a seemingly endless series of security incidents for T-Mobile in the last year. In October of 2017, Motherboard revealed that hackers had found a nasty bug in a company website that allowed them to look up customers’ personal data just by having their phone numbers. The criminals used it to access customers’ personal information, leveraging it to steal cell phone numbers in the increasingly pervasive scam known as SIM swapping, or SIM hijacking.
T-Mobile initially said it had “found no evidence of customer accounts affected,” but that turned out not to be accurate. Days later, T-Mobile alerted “a few hundred customers” who had been targeted by hackers. Then, in February of this year, T-Mobile sent out a mass text warning customers of the threat of SIM swapping.
In February, a security researcher reported a “critical” bug in another T-Mobile site that would’ve allowed hackers to hijack customer’s accounts. It was fixed before anyone exploited it, according to the company.
Also, in 2015, T-Mobile was breached and lost the personal data—this time including social security numbers—of 15 million people.

"262","MyFitnessPal","150,000,000","2018","Personal details of about 150 million users of the MyFitnessPal app were compromised in one of the biggest hacks in history, its owner has confirmed.
US sportswear brand Under Armour said user names, email addresses and scrambled passwords were among the stolen data. However, payment card data was not affected. It urged customers to change their passwords immediately.
The company said on Thursday that the accounts were compromised in February, sending shares of the company down 3% in after-hours trade. The breach was not discovered until 25 March and users were informed four days later.
Under Armour said: “We do not know the identity of the unauthorised party. Our investigation into this matter is ongoing.”
The app allows customers to monitor their calorie intake and measure it against the amount of exercise they are doing using a database of more than 2 million foods. It was founded in 2005 by brothers Mike and Albert Lee.
The data breach is the largest this year and one of the top five to date, based on the number of records compromised, according to SecurityScorecard, a risk management consultancy.
Larger hacks included 3bn Yahoo accounts compromised in 2013 and credentials for more than 412 million users of adult websites run by California-based FriendFinder Networks Inc in 2016.
Under Armour said it was working with data security firms and law enforcement, but did not provide details on how the hackers got into its network or pulled out the data without getting caught.
While the breach did not include financial data, large caches of stolen email addresses can be valuable to cybercriminals.
Email addresses retrieved in a 2014 attack that compromised data on some 83 million JPMorgan Chase customers was later used in “pump-and-dump” schemes to boost stock prices, according to US federal indictments in the case in 2015.
Under Armour bought MyFitnessPal in 2015 for $475m (£338m). It is part of the company’s connected fitness division, whose revenue last year accounted for 1.8% of Under Armour’s $5bn in total sales.

"263","Health South East","3,000,000","2018","More details have emerged on the data breach at Norway’s largest healthcare authority, in which up to 3 million people may have had their data stolen.
The attack on Helse Sør-Øst RHF (Health South-East) appears to have focused on patient records and the health service’s relationship with Norway’s armed forces. AldriMer reported that the criminal hackers were looking for information related to Trident Juncture 18, a major NATO exercise taking place in Norway in October 2018.
The combination of patients’ healthcare data and sensitive military data made Health South-East a prime target for an attack. The authority’s lax security has also been made public, with VG reporting in June 2017 that about 1,200 of Health South-East’s computers were still running on Windows XP.
Windows stopped providing updates and support for XP in 2014, meaning any organisation still using it is vulnerable to exploits. The legacy system was initially thought to be responsible for the rampant spread of last year’s WannaCry attack. Even though this turned out to be largely untrue (computers running on XP tended to crash before the ransomware was installed), there’s still a massive risk when using legacy systems.
Christian Jacobsen, chief information security officer at third-party organisation Sykehuspartner HF (Hospital Partner), acknowledged that the widespread use of Windows XP was a security risk, but claimed that control mechanisms had been put in place to reduce risk.
He added that the organisation aimed to phase out Windows XP. It’s not known how many computers were still running on XP at the time of the attack.
The threat to healthcare
Commenting on the incident, Gary Cox, director of Western Europe at Infoblox, told SC Media: “The wealth of sensitive information held by healthcare organisations is immensely valuable to criminals and, as technology becomes more ingrained into core healthcare offerings, there is an increased threat of cyber-attacks stealing sensitive patient data, disrupting services, and putting lives at risk.”
He added: “It’s crucial that healthcare IT professionals plan strategically about how they can manage risk within their organisation and respond to active threats to ensure the security and safety of patients and their data.”
Paul Farrington, manager at CA Technologies, said: “[I]t is crucial that healthcare organisations continue to invest in their cyber-security defences. This is the second [recent] high profile attack on healthcare organisations […], following the ransomware attack on Hancock Regional Hospital in Indiana, making it clear that the healthcare industry is a prominent target.”
Keeping your organisation secure
Targeted cyber attacks are just one way your organisation can be breached. You also need to protect against phishing, ransomware, malicious insiders, accidental disclosures and a host of other threats.
To be able to respond and recover from a cyber incident, it’s essential that you implement an effective business continuity management system (BCMS).
A BCMS is a comprehensive approach to organisational resilience. It helps organisations update, control and deploy effective plans, taking into account organisational contingencies and capabilities, as well as business needs.
With a BCMS, you can cope with any incident affecting your business-critical processes and activities, from the failure of a single server to the complete loss of a major facility. Starting the implementation process can seem intimidating, especially if you have little knowledge of the system, so we’ve provided some advice in our free green paper: Business Continuity Management – the nine-step approach.

"264","Nametests","120,000,000","2018","Nametests.com, the website behind the quizzes, recently fixed a flaw that publicly exposed information of their more than 120 million monthly users — even after they deleted the app. At my request, Facebook donated $8,000 to the Freedom of the Press Foundation as part of their Data Abuse Bounty Program.
In the light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook tried to clean up its act by launching their data abuse bounty program. Being a participant in their Bug Bounty Program, I got triggered and decided to give it a shot. I scrolled through my timeline and noted down all apps my friends were using. Fitness trackers and Facebook Quizzes topped my list. The latter have been heavily criticised for their massive data harvesting and data-greedy permissions, so for the first time in my life, I took a Facebook Quiz:
According to nametests.com, if I were a Disney Princess, I would be Jasmine.
Upon closer investigation, I noticed something strange.
While loading a test, the website would fetch my personal information and display it on the webpage. Here’s where it got my personal information from:
In theory, every website could have requested this data. Note that the data also includes a ‘token’ which gives access to all data the user authorised the application to access, such as photos, posts and friends.
I was shocked to see that this data was publicly available to any third-party that requested it.
In a normal situation, other websites would not be able to access this information. Web browsers have mechanisms in place to prevent that from happening. In this case however, the data was wrapped in something called javascript, which is an exception to this rule.
One of the basic principles of javascript is that it can be shared with other websites. Since NameTests displayed their user’s personal data in javascript file, virtually any website could access it when they would request it.
NameTests wants to know who you are so they ask nametests.com/appconfig_user, but any other website could do that as well.
To verify it would actually be that easy to steal someone’s information, I set up a website that would connect to NameTests and get some information about my visitor. NameTests would also provide a secret key called an access token, which, depending on the permissions granted, could be used to gain access to a visitor’s posts, photos and friends. It would only take one visit to our website to gain access to someone’s personal information for up to two months.
As you can see in the video, NameTests would still reveal your identity even after deleting the app. In order to prevent this from happening, the user would have had to manually delete the cookies on their device, since NameTests.com does not offer a log out functionality.
I would imagine you wouldn’t want any website to know who you are, let alone steal your information or photos. Abusing this flaw, advertisers could have targeted (political) ads based on your Facebook posts and friends. More explicit websites could have abused this flaw to blackmail their visitors, threatening to leak your sneaky search history to your friends.
Timeline of events:
On April, 22nd, I reported this to Facebook’s Data Abuse program.
On April 30th, I received an initial response from Facebook, stating that they’re looking still looking into it.
On May 14th, I sent a follow-up mail, asking whether they already reached out to the app developers.
On May 22th, Facebook said that it could take three to six months to investigate the issue (as mentioned in their initial automated reply) and that they would keep me in the loop. At this time, the NameTests quizzes were still up and running.
On June, 25th I noticed NameTests had changed the way they process data. Third-parties could no longer access its users personal information. I contacted them about the fix, told them about this blogpost and asked them to donate the bounty to Freedom of the Press Foundation.
On June, 26th, I reached out to NameTest’s Digital Protection Officer to answer some questions regarding the vulnerability and the disclosure process by Facebook.
On June, 27th, Facebook informed me they donated $8,000 ($4,000 bounty, doubled because I chose to donate it to charity) to the Freedom of the Press foundation as part of their data abuse bounty program:
I also got a response from NameTests. The public relations team claims that, according to the data and knowledge they have, they found no evidence of abuse by a third party. They also state that they have implemented additional tests to find such bugs and avoid them in the future. As soon as I get permission to publish our conversation, I will post it here for the sake of completeness.
On June, 28, I published this blog post. In response to this, Facebook issued a public statement on their Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/BugBounty/posts/2117617158252499
I have mixed feelings about this one. I am glad both Facebook and NameTests cooperated and resolved the issue. On the other hand, we cannot accept that the information of hundreds of millions of users could have been leaked out so easily. We can and must do better.

FAQ
How many users were affected?
According to Facebook, NameTests has more than 120 million active monthly users. I have no insights in how many users have given their data to the app since their launch early 2015. It is important to note that if this flaw was ever abused, only the users that actually visited the attacker’s website would have their data leaked to the attacker.
To get more grip on the reach of these quizzes, I made a list of their NameTest’s localised Facebook pages pages with more than one million likes. Pretty scary numbers, considering the fact you don’t even have to like their Facebook page to take a quiz. Their potential reach is immense:
There are so many NameTests pages that I only published the ones with +1M likes.
How long did this flaw exist?
Looking at archive.org, the flaw has been there at least since the end of 2016.
NameTests said they introduced the script on the 24th of January, 2017.
Did NameTests know about this?
I have no evidence to claim that. It could have been a rookie programming mistake, but given the fact that this went unnoticed since 2016, it raises some serious questions about the way they handle the security of their hundreds of millions of users. Their terms of service are pretty clear on this:
NO CLAIMS OR PROMISES ABOUT THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE SITE, ITS SAFETY OR SECURITY, OR THE SITE CONTENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVIDER’S ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT MIGHT ARISE, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM THE SITE’S INOPERABILITY, UNAVAILABILITY OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES OR FROM YOUR RELIANCE ON THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE CONTENT, BUSINESS LISTINGS, RATINGS, REVIEWS, METRICS, OR REVIEW FILTER FOUND ON, USED ON, OR MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE.
Their Digital Protection Officer did let me know that they take data security very seriously, though.
Was this flaw ever discovered by someone else?
It’s hard to tell. I can only say that it was really easy to spot, and I would be surprised if nobody else found this earlier, given the website claims to generate more than 3 billion page views every month, most of which had references to the leaky javascript. NameTests does state that, according to the data and knowledge they have, they did not find any evidence of abuse.
What data could have been leaked?
Depending on what quizzes you took, the javascript could leak your facebook ID, first name, last name, language, gender, date of birth, profile picture, cover photo, currency, devices you use, when your information was last updated, your posts and statuses, your photos and your friends.
What data could have been leaked after the app was deleted?
If you ever took a quiz and removed the app afterwards, external websites would still be able to read your facebook id, first name, last name, language, gender, date of birth. You could have only prevented this from happening if you manually deleted your cookies, as the website does not offer a logout functionality.
How can I protect myself from against these kind of leaks?
Delete any apps that you’re currently not using, be wary when giving new apps access to your data and delete your cookies on a regular basis.

"265","Ticketmaster","40,000","2018","Ticketmaster has admitted that it has suffered a security breach, which the BBC understands has affected up to 40,000 UK customers.
Malicious software on third-party customer support product Inbenta Technologies caused the hack, the firm said on Twitter.
""Some personal or payment information may have been accessed by an unknown third party"", it added.
All affected customers have been contacted.
In the email to those customers, Ticketmaster said it had set up a website to answer any questions and advised them to reset their passwords. It also offered them a free 12-month identity monitoring service.
It said the breach was likely to have only affected UK customers who purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between February and 23 June 2018.
But, as a precaution, it said it had also informed international customers who had purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between September 2017 and 23 June 2018.
The company added that North American customers were not affected.
Information that may have been compromised includes names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment details and Ticketmaster log-in details.
It said that ""forensic teams and security experts are working around the clock"" to understand how data was compromised.
Ticketmaster is confident it has complied with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules - acting very quickly and informing all relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner's office.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre - a division of GCHQ - said it was monitoring the situation.
""The NCSC is working with our partners to better understand the incident,"" added a spokesman.
Ticketmaster's parent, Live Nation, declared it had 86 million customers in its most recent annual report.
However, a spokeswoman was unable to break out a figure for Ticketmaster's total number of UK clients.
One expert said members of the public should now be on the lookout for follow-up phishing scams.
""After an incident like this, criminals from around the world will jump at the chance to try and catch a few unsuspecting people out,"" said Brooks Wallace from the cyber-security specialist Trusted Knight.
""If you receive any emails purporting to be from Ticketmaster asking for any personal information, discard them. If you need to contact Ticketmaster, type the website address into your browser and log-in that way.""

"266","Firebase","100,000,000","2018","Thousands of iOS and Android mobile applications are exposing over 113 GBs of data via over 2,271 misconfigured Firebase databases, according to a report released this week by mobile security firm Appthority.
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service offering from Google that contains a vast collection of services that mobile developers can use in the creation of mobile and web-based apps.
The service is insanely popular with top Android devs, providing cloud messaging, push notifications, database, analytics, advertising, and a bunch more of other backends and APIs that they can easily plug into their projects and benefit from Google's large-scale and high-performance systems within their apps.
Appthority scanned over 2.7 million mobile apps
Starting with January 2018, Appthority researchers scanned mobile apps that used Firebase systems to store user data, analyzing the app's communications pattern for requests made to Firebase domains.
Researchers searched in particular for apps that connected to Firebase-based JSON URLs that when accessed directly, allowed any unauthorized third-party to view all the app's data.
After scanning more than 2.7 million iOS and Android apps, researchers said they identified 28,502 mobile apps (27,227 Android and 1,275 iOS) that connected and stored data inside Firebase backends.
Of these, 3,046 apps (2,446 Android and 600 iOS) saved data inside 2,271 misconfigured Firebase databases that allowed anyone to view their content.
In total, the databases exposed more than 100 million records of user data. The leaked information weighed more than 113 GBs and included data such as:
2.6 million plaintext passwords and user IDs
4 million+ PHI (Protected Health Information) records (chat messages and prescription details)
25 million GPS location records
50 thousand financial records including banking, payment and Bitcoin transactions
4.5 million+ Facebook, LinkedIn, Firebase, and corporate data store user tokens
Appthority says the Android versions of the leaky apps alone have been downloaded more than 620 million times from the official Google Play Store, suggesting some pretty popular apps were running on top of these leaky backends.
Google notified of the leaky apps and servers
The security firm also said it notified Google about this issue before publishing its report and provided a list of affected apps and Firebase database servers.
This is not the first time that Appthority finds that app backend servers are exposing critical user data. Last year, the company published the HospitalGown report in which it revealed that over 1,000 apps exposed over 43 TBs of user data via MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB, Elasticsearch, and MySQL backend servers.
Also last year, Appthority researchers discovered that tens of developers had left API credentials in hundreds of applications built around the Twilio service, exposing customers' private call recordings and SMS text messages.

"267","Aadhaar","1,100,000,000","2018","India's national ID database has been hit by yet another major security lapse.
Known as Aadhaar, the government ID database is packed with identity and biometric information -- like fingerprints and iris scans -- on more than 1.1 billion registered Indian citizens, official figures show. Anyone in the database can use their data -- or their thumbprint -- to open a bank account, buy a cellular SIM card, enroll in utilities, and even receive state aid or financial assistance. Even companies, like Amazon and Uber, can tap into the Aadhaar database to identify their customers.
Enrolling in the database isn't mandatory, but Indian citizens who aren't subscribed are unable to access even basic government services. Other countries are set to follow India's lead.
But the system has been dogged with security problems -- including, according to India's Tribune, a data breach. India's ruling Bharatiya Janata political party later called the report ""fake news.""
Now, the database was leaking information on every Aadhaar holder, a security researcher has told ZDNet.
A data leak on a system run by a state-owned utility company Indane allowed anyone to download private information on all Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and information about services they are connected to, such as their bank details and other private information.
Karan Saini, a New Delhi-based security researcher who found the vulnerable endpoint, said that anyone with an Aadhaar number is affected.
Yet the Indian authorities did nothing for weeks to fix the flaw. ZDNet spent more than a month trying to contact Indane, and the Indian authorities -- including the Indian government's National Informatics Centre. Nobody responded to our repeated emails.
We later contacted the Indian Consulate in New York and alerted Devi Prasad Misra, consul for trade and customs. Over two weeks, this issue was explained in detail, and we responded to many follow-up questions. A week passed, and the vulnerability was still not fixed. At the start of this week, we told the consul that we would publish our story on Friday and requested comment from the Indian government.
The consul did not respond to that last email. At the time of publishing, the affected system was still online and vulnerable -- but, within hours after our story posted, the affected endpoint was pulled offline.
Predictably, India's Unique Identification Authority (UIDAI), the government department that administers the Aadhaar database, issued a strong denial.
""There is no truth in this story as there has been absolutely no breach of UIDAI's Aadhaar database. Aadhaar remains safe and secure,"" says a portion of the statement, posted to Twitter, which you can read here.
The utility provider Indane has access to the Aadhaar database through an API, which the company relies on to check a customer's status and verify their identity.
But because the company hadn't secured the API, it was possible to retrieve private data on each Aadhaar holder, regardless of whether they're a customer of the utility provider or not.
The API's endpoint -- a URL on the company's domain -- had no access controls in place, said Saini. The affected endpoint used a hardcoded access token, which, when decoded, translates to ""INDAADHAARSECURESTATUS,"" allowing anyone to query Aadhaar numbers against the database without any additional authentication.
Saini also found that the API didn't have any rate limiting in place, allowing an attacker to cycle through every permutation -- potentially trillions -- of Aadhaar numbers and obtain information each time a successful result is hit.
He explained that it would be possible to enumerate Aadhaar numbers by cycling through combinations, such as 1234 5678 0000 to 1234 5678 9999.
""An attacker is bound to find some valid Aadhaar numbers there which could then be used to find their corresponding details,"" he said. And because there is no rate limiting, Saini said he could send thousands of requests each minute -- just from one computer.
When Saini ran a handful of Aadhaar numbers (from friends who gave him permission) through the endpoint, the server's response included the Aadhaar holder's full name and their consumer number -- a unique customer number used by Indane. The response also reveals information on connected bank accounts, said Saini. Screenshots seen by ZDNet reveal details about which bank that person uses -- though, no other banking information was returned.
That seems to contradict a tweet by UIDAI, which said: ""Aadhaar database does not keep any information about bank accounts.""
Another tweet on the same day by Ravi Shankar Prasad, India's minister for electronics and information technology, also said: ""Aadhaar does not save the details of your bank account.""
The endpoint didn't just pull data on the utility provider's customers; the API allowed access to Aadhaar holders' information who have connections with other utility companies, as well.
""From the requests that were sent to check for a rate limiting issue and determine the possibility of stumbling across valid Aadhaar numbers, I have found that this information is not retrieved from a static database or a one-off data grab, but is clearly being updated -- from as early as 2014 to mid 2017,"" he told ZDNet. ""I cannot speculate whether it is UIDAI that is providing this information to [the utility provider], or if the banks or gas companies are, but it seems that everyone's information is available, with no authentication -- no rate limit, nothing.""
That data on the face of it may not be seen as sensitive as leaked or exposed biometric data, but it nevertheless contradicts the Indian government's claims that the database is secure.
India's former attorney general Mukul Rohtagi once said that a previous leak of Aadhaar numbers is ""much ado about nothing.""
But access to Aadhaar numbers and corresponding names increases the risk of identity theft, or could lead to impersonation.
It's long been believed that identity theft is one of the biggest issues faced by both UIDAI and Aadhaar number holders. It's been reported that linking Aadhaar numbers to SIM cards has led to stolen money and fraud.
The controversy surrounding the Aadhaar database has been ongoing. A month ahead of the Indian election in 2014, would-be prime minister Narendra Modi called the database's security into question.
""On Aadhaar, neither the team that I met nor PM could answer my [questions] on security threat it can pose. There is no vision, only political gimmick,"" said Modi in a tweet.
Now, his government is currently defending the identity scheme in front of the country's Supreme Court. Critics have called the database unconstitutional.
Until the court rules on the case, subscribing to the database won't be mandatory for Indian citizens. But that might not be much solace for those whose information has been already collected.

"268","Grindr","3,000,000","2018","Grindr, a gay-dating app, suffers from a security issue that can expose the information of its more than 3 million daily users, including the location data of people who have opted out of sharing such information, according to cybersecurity experts.
The security flaw was identified by Trever Faden, CEO of the property management startup Atlas Lane, after he created a website called C*ckblocked (the asterisk is part of the name of the service). His website allowed users to see who blocked them on Grindr after they entered their Grindr username and password. Once they did so, Faden was able to gain access to a trove of user data that is not publicly available on user profiles, including unread messages, email addresses, deleted photos, and the location data of users, some of whom have opted to not share their locations publicly.
Faden’s website exploited a similar security loophole to the one that leaked the information of 50 million Facebook users through a quiz connected to the social network, highlighting the risk that people face in using existing social media accounts to log in to other services.
Grindr makes public the location of many of its users, but allows for users to opt out of this feature. Faden found that he could find the location of users who had opted out if they connected their Grindr profiles through his third-party website.
“One could, without too much difficulty or even a huge amount of technological skill, easily pinpoint a user's exact location,"" Faden explained. Two independent cybersecurity researchers, neither affiliated with Faden nor Grindr, backed up Faden's claim.
In a statement issued to NBC News, Grindr said it was aware of the vulnerability that Faden had found and had changed its system to prevent access to data regarding blocked accounts. The company did not change access to any of the other data. After Grindr changed its policy on access to data on which users had blocked other users, Faden shut down his website.
The company also warned people not to use their Grindr logins for other apps or websites.
“Grindr moved quickly to make changes to its platform to resolve this issue,” the company said in the statement. “Grindr reminds all users that they should never give away their username and password to any third parties claiming to provide a benefit, as they are not authorized by Grindr and could potentially have malicious intent.”
The company also used Twitter to warn users against sharing their information with third parties. “Using unauthorized tools puts your Grindr account at risk,” the tweet stated.
""It’s a feature, not a bug,” Faden said, characterizing conversations he had with employees at Grindr about the availability of location data.
Faden said that he did not share or collect any user data to which he was given access other than telling Grindr users that accessed his website who had blocked them on the app.
This is not the first time that issues with Grindr’s security around location data has been reported.
Grindr’s security issues first came to light in 2014, when security researchers at cybersecurity firm Synack found that Grindr let any user see the profiles and locations of people anywhere in the world. Grindr did make some changes, allowing users to turn off its pinpoint location function and turning off the default location option in countries where gay people face violence and persecution. Two years after the location data was first revealed and addressed by Grindr, security researchers found they were still able to figure out users’ locations.
Location data for Grindr users is particularly sensitive. Grindr has users in 234 countries and territories around the world. Homosexuality is illegal in more than 70 nations, and 13 of them implement the death penalty for homosexual acts, according to a 2016 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).
Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, reviewed Faden’s findings and confirmed the flaw.
“There are a million reasons why you might not want someone to find your location through Grindr, and Grindr is dealing with that as a non-issue,” Quintin said. “They’re putting people’s lives at risk by doing that.”
In addition to the new security flaw, Faden also demonstrated the ease and speed with which he could find users who had not opted out of sharing location data.
NBC News created a new account on the service, and Faden pinpointed its location almost immediately.
The screenshot below, sent by Faden, shows that he was able to find the new profile, which was pinpointed down to the area of the building in which the user was located, in a matter of minutes. This capability is open to any user that joins the app and requires no verification or authentication.
The data flaw raises questions about the security of Grindr's users around the world. Among the experts raising concerns is Harlo Holmes, director of newsroom digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Holmes said it’s important that companies like Grindr, which gather deeply personal information from users, not let that data fall into the wrong hands.
“Dating apps must especially take care to protect users from letting bad actors access sensitive data,” Holmes said. “This type of info exposure betrays our trust that the service can determine what fields of data should be public and private.”
Holmes said unlike Twitter, which is more public and which is transparent about who has blocked whom, Grindr introduces the additional layer of sexual orientation, and the release of a user's personal information could lead to increased stalking and other forms of sex-based harassment.
“LGBTQ folks have vastly different legal standing across countries and continents,” Holmes added.
C*ckblocked — which was neither associated with Grindr nor the Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech, which owns a majority stake in Grindr — first went live on Friday, March 16. By the following Wednesday, nearly 50,000 people had signed on to the service with the emails and passwords they use for their personal Grindr accounts, according to Faden. His algorithm took the authentication tokens sent back from Grindr servers, then accessed each user’s metadata to show them who blocked their accounts. Faden said he did not store their login information.
Norman Shamas, an independent cyber security consultant, said the initial landing page of C*ckblocked resembled any standard phishing scam.
“When I saw it, my immediate thought was, ‘This is a very similar social engineering attack to a phishing site,’” Shamas said. “My response is to tell people to not type anything in and not use it.”
Shamas said while Faden may not have created the site with malicious intent, there are risks when giving login information to third parties. Teaching people to trust services like C*ckblocked, Shamas added, could make future attacks with malicious intent more successful.
Shamas also shared concerns about an article posted to Grindr-owned digital publication INTO. The outlet published an article about C*ckblocked earlier this month that seemingly glossed over the data aspect, focusing instead on how the third-party service exposed the pattern of white men blocking men of color on the app.
""They normalized this app by having this article up, and it’s not really doing anything,"" Shamas said, expressing concern that the article appears to be promoting a third-party product which has gained access to sensitive personal information. Shamas also expressed concern that the article could inspire more services that phish login information from users.
“If there’s a desire for third-party apps, then building out some sort of interface, like with Facebook, where they could control the data ... that could help mitigate the risk against someone going to a place like C*ckblocked,"" Shamas said.
For his part, Faden maintains he has no intention of using the data his website has harvested for nefarious purposes. He also warned, however, that it can be easy to bypass even the best online security measures.
“The single weakest point in most security chains is often the human element,” he said. “Not backdoors, not weak authentication schemes — just people with malicious intent that know enough to dupe other people.”

"270","MBM Company","1,300,000","2018","Few people are familiar with the Chicago-based MBM Company, Inc, but perhaps you might be familiar with its jewelry brand Limogés Jewelry. This firm sells cut-price trinkets through its website to customers across the US and Canada.
Researchers from German security firm Kromtech Security allege that until recently, MBM Company was improperly handling customer details. On February 6, they identified an unsecured Amazon S3 storage bucket, containing a MSSQL database backup file.
According to Kromtech Security’s head of communications, Bob Diachenko, further analysis of the file revealed it held the personal information for over 1.3 million people. This includes addresses, zip-codes, e-mail addresses, and IP addresses. He also claims the database contained plaintext passwords — which is a big security ‘no-no.’
In a press release, Diachenko said: “Passwords were stored in the plain text, which is great negligence [sic], taking into account the problem with many users re-using passwords for multiple accounts, including email accounts.”
The backup file was named ‘MBMWEB_backup_2018_01_13_003008_2864410.bak,’ which suggests the file was created on January 13, 2018. It’s believed to contain current information about the company’s customers. Records held in the database have dates reaching as far back as 2000. The latest records are from the start of this year.
Other records held in the database include internal mailing lists, promo-codes, and item orders, which leads Kromtech to believe that this could be the primary customer database for the company.
TNW spoke to Diachenko earlier today. When asked to put the severity of this incident into context, he said: “I consider it as a quite serious incident for a number of factors. First, [it has] a rather ‘easy-to-guess’ bucket name which opens a big possibility that somebody has already seen the data. With so many scanning tools available online, there is a big chance that this combination of a ‘big brand and common suffix’ S3 domain name has appeared on someone’s radar.”
It’s worth noting that there’s no evidence a malicious third-party has accessed the dump. Diachenko said Kromtech’s researchers didn’t notice any ransom notes, which regularly appear in compromised MongoDB and CouchDB databases. However, he added, “that does not mean that nobody [has] accessed the data.”
Diachenko is also concerned about the presence of plaintext passwords in the data file. “There is a great concern that many users [are] re-using passwords for multiple accounts, including email accounts,” he said.
According to Diachenko, MBM Company failed to respond to Kromtech’s researchers, but instead quietly secured the Amazon S3 bucket.
Improperly protected Amazon S3 buckets have ensnared a lot of big-name companies in security SNAFUs. Even though it’s trivially easy to add proper authentication to a bucket, institutions like FedEx, web analytics firm Alteryx, RNC contractor Deep Root, and the City of Chicago have all been caught with their pants down.
Diachenko recommends that anyone who wants to use this technology first familiarizes themselves with the security basics of it. And for anyone who has bought a bargain-basement engagement ring lately, he suggests they change their passwords, and sign up for Troy Hunt’s Have You Been Pwned.

"271","LocalBlox","48,000,000","2018","The UpGuard Cyber Risk Team can now confirm that a cloud storage repository containing information belonging to LocalBlox, a personal and business data search service, was left publicly accessible, exposing 48 million records of detailed personal information on tens of millions of individuals, gathered and scraped from multiple sources.
This data includes names, physical addresses, dates of birth, scraped data from LinkedIn and Facebook, Twitter handles, and more.  Ashfaq Rahman, co-founder of LocalBlox, a company that bills itself as the “World's Most Comprehensive Cross Device Identity Graph on Businesses, Consumers and Geo Audiences,” has confirmed to UpGuard that the exposed information belongs to them.
In the wake of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica debacle, the importance of massive sets of psychographic data is becoming more and more apparent. The exposed LocalBlox dataset combines standard personal information like name and address, with data about the person’s internet usage, such as their LinkedIn histories and Twitter feeds. This combination begins to build a three-dimensional picture of every individual affected— who they are, what they talk about, what they like, even what they do for a living— in essence a blueprint from which to create targeted persuasive content, like advertising or political campaigning. If the legitimate uses of the data aren’t enough to give pause, the illegitimate uses range from traditional identity theft, to fraud, to ammunition for social engineering scams such as phishing.
The Discovery
On February 18th, 2018  an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket located at the subdomain “lbdumps” was discovered by the UpGuard Cyber Risk Team, publicly downloadable and configured for access via the internet. The bucket contained one 151.3 GB compressed file, which, when decompressed, revealed a 1.2 TB ndjson (newline-delineated json) file. Metadata in a header file pointed to LocalBlox as the owner. After downloading and beginning to analyze this extremely large data file, the UpGuard Cyber Risk Team notified LocalBlox of the exposure on February 28th; the bucket was secured later that day.
The file name provides some indication of the contents: “final_people_data_2017_5_26_48m.json.” As hinted, the massive file contains 48 million records, each in json format and separated by new lines. This master list corroborates information gathered from a variety of sources about individuals. The sheer breadth of the exposed data includes such information as individuals’ names, physical addresses, dates of birth, scraped LinkedIn job histories, public Facebook data, and individuals’ Twitter handles. In addition, it appears the prominent real estate site Zillow is used in the process as well, with information being somehow blended from the service's listings into the larger data pool. The database appears to work by tracking an IP address, matching collected data to that IP address when able, and thus providing a clearer image of the behavior and background of the user at that IP address. 
Also of interest are exposed source fields, providing some indication of where the scraps of data were collected from. Some are fairly unambiguous, pointing to aggregated content, purchased marketing databases, or even information caches sold by payday loan operators to businesses seeking marketing data. Other fields are more mysterious, such as a source field labeled “ex.”
Included among the data are several Facebook data points, filled from queries like this one present in the dataset. In those instances the <query> and <email> fields were populated with the person's name and email address:
Some of the data points associated with these queries include pictures, skills, lastUpdated, companies, currentJob, familyAdditionalDetails, Favorites, mergedIdentities, and a field labeled allSentences which includes other text from the search results. That text includes results that suggest this information was scraped from the Facebook html rather than gathered through the API. For example, this text from one record appears to come from the Facebook page footer in 2016:
This data highlights the ease with which Facebook data can be scraped, and the ubiquity of Facebook information in psychographic datasets. According to their website, “LocalBlox is the First Global Customer Intelligence Platform to search, combine and validate deep business and people profiles – at scale.” The exposed data wasn’t just a customer list, but the very product LocalBlox offers. Their value statements about the power of their data provide some insight into exactly why exposing such data is extremely dangerous. According to the LocalBlox website, “The need for deeper, more accurate data about individual businesses and consumers is becoming more urgent to compete.” This data is valuable because it can be used effectively, and this efficacy can become dangerous if put to malicious use.
The Significance
Social awareness of data exposure and its consequences has grown in parallel with the scope of datasets being aggregated, stored, shipped, and copied by numerous organizations around the world. The LocalBlox dataset, 1.2 terabytes in size, contained 48 million records on a lesser or similar number of individual people. The presence of scraped data from social media sites like Facebook also highlights an important fact: all too often, data held by widely used websites can be targeted by unknown third parties seeking to monetize this information. In such cases, both a targeted website like Facebook and any affected users are being victimized, as personal information entrusted to the social network is snatched up for the benefit of a platform of which no one is aware.
More importantly, the data gathered on these people connected their identity and online behaviors and activity, all in the context of targeted marketing, i.e. how best to persuade them. It is exactly this persuasive factor that lies at the heart of discussions about how data is gathered and sold: when aggregated together at scale, your psychographic data can be used to influence you. It is what makes exposures of this nature so dangerous, and also what drives not only the business model of LocalBlox, but of the entire data analytics industry. As it says on the LocalBlox website, the “Data and Analytics Market is Booming,"" and this is reflected in the advertising copy the site employs.
With this kind of business interest in data harvesting, processing, and resale, it should be no wonder that so many massive and intrusive data sets exist in the world, providing companies and political parties with detailed blueprints on how to influence people. 
What should be a wonder is that these datasets aren’t better secured and administered. This exposure was not the result of a clever hack, or well-planned scheme, but of a simple misconfiguration of an enterprise asset— an S3 storage bucket— which left the data open to the entire internet. The profitability gained by data must come with the responsibility of protecting its integrity and privacy. Cloud storage itself provides functionality and speed at a reasonable cost, but cloud assets require careful configuration— the thin line between private and public can be erased with the flip of a single switch. The lack of controls around common IT processes are what allow critical errors like this to slip into production, eroding the privacy of millions of people.

"272","Twitter","330,000,000","2018","Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) urged its more than 330 million users to change their passwords after a glitch caused some to be stored in readable text on its internal computer system rather than disguised by a process known as “hashing”.
The social network disclosed the issue in a blog post and series of Tweets on Thursday afternoon, saying it had resolved the problem and an internal investigation had found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. Still, it urged all users to consider changing their passwords.
“We fixed the bug and have no indication of a breach or misuse by anyone,” Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a Tweet. “As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password.”
The blog did not say how many passwords were affected. A person familiar with the company’s response said the number was “substantial” and that they were exposed for “several months.”
The disclosure comes as lawmakers and regulators around the world scrutinize the way that companies store and secure consumer data, after a string of security incidents at Equifax Inc (EFX.N), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].
The European Union is due later this month to start enforcing a strict new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, that includes steep fees for violators.
Twitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which investigates companies accused of deceptive practices related to data security, declined comment on the password glitch.
The agency settled with Twitter in 2010 over accusations the site had “serious lapses” in data security that let hackers access private user data on two occasions. The settlement called for audits of Twitter’s data security program every other year for 10 years.
The glitch was related to Twitter’s use of “hashing” and caused passwords to be written on an internal computer log before the scrambling process was completed, the blog said.  
“We are very sorry this happened,” the Twitter blog said.
Twitter’s share price was down 1 percent in extended trade at $30.35, after gaining 0.4 percent during the session.
The company advised users to take precautions to ensure that their accounts are safe, including changing passwords and enabling Twitter’s two-factor authentication service to help prevent accounts from being hijacked.

The data includes, among others, national identity numbers (ID numbers), e-mail addresses, full names, as well as plain text passwords to what appears to be a traffic fines related online system.
Working together with Troy Hunt, an Australian Security consultant and founder of haveibeenpwned, along with an anonymous source that has been communicating with iAfrikan and Hunt, we've managed to establish that the data was backed up or posted publicly by one of the companies responsible for traffic fines online payments in South Africa.
""I have a new leak which might be worthwhile, the database leak contains 1 million records of personal information of South African citizens. Including Identity numbers, cell phone numbers, email addresses, and passwords. I am aware of the website this was leaked from,” said our source upon initial contact.
They further added that the database which contains just under 1 million personal records, was discovered on a public web server that belongs to a company that handles electronic traffic fine payments in South Africa. iAfrikan was able to view the publicly available database and, just like the 2017 data leak of 60 million personal records of South Africans, it appears to be a possible case of negligence and carelessness when handle citizens data directory listing/browsing were enabled on the directory where their ""backups"" were saved.
“This is yet another reminder of how far our data can spread without our knowledge. In this case, in particular, the presence of plain text passwords poses a serious risk because inevitably, those passwords will unlock many of the other accounts victims of the breach use. This one incident has likely already led to multiple other breaches of online accounts due to that reuse,” said Hunt to iAfrikan.
Online traffic fine payments
South Africa has several companies that allow and facilitate the payment of traffic fines online. These include using Internet banking with some of the banks, PayCity, ViewFines, and PoCit, to name some of them.
It is also important to highlight that the leaked database, does not represent the total population of licensed drivers in South Africa. According to data from eNATIS, at the end of March 2017, South Africa had just over 12 million licensed drivers compared to the leaked database' 934,000.
However, if you have ever registered on any system online that allows you to receive notifications and pay for traffic fines, it is best you go change your password. Also, as Hunt has indicated, you will be able to verify if your data was included in the leak from 24 May 2018 on haveibeenpwned.
Pressure
The leak also comes at a time when South Africa's Information Regulator is being put under pressure to act or share feedback on recent data leaks involving South African citizens data. This also includes the data of South Africans affected by the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica saga.
""If people want to check if they were impacted, they’ll be able to do so then [starting 24 May 2018] or subscribe to the free notification service now and they’ll get an email as soon as it loads,"" concluded Hunt.

Now this page contains an overview of what happened. We are sorry this incident occurred.
On May 30, 2018, we discovered unauthorized access to the Ticketfly platform.
We take privacy and security very seriously and, upon first learning about this incident, took swift action to secure the data of our clients and fans. This included making the difficult decision to temporarily take all Ticketfly systems offline while consulting with third-party forensic cybersecurity experts and vigorously investigating the incident.
Our investigation confirmed that financial information, including credit and debit cards, was not accessed. Information, including names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers, connected to approximately 27 million Ticketfly accounts was accessed. Please note that many people purchase tickets with multiple email accounts, so the number of individuals impacted is likely lower.
As soon as we had confidence that we could bring the Ticketfly ticketing systems and websites back online safely and securely, we began the work to do so.
The Ticketfly ticketing system and all websites have now been fully restored.
Information accessed includes names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers connected to Ticketfly accounts. No credit and debit card information was accessed.
We understand there is curiosity as to who perpetrated this attack, and how. Unfortunately, we are limited in what specific details we can share. We can convey that our enhanced security measures are intended to help make sure this does not happen again.

The e-commerce giant said it has emailed affected customers but refused to give any more details on how many people were affected or where they are based.
The firm said the issue was not a breach of its website or any of its systems, but a technical issue that inadvertently posted customer names and email addresses to its website.
In a short statement, Amazon said: “We have fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted.”
Customers who received the email were told: “Our website inadvertently disclosed your email address or name and email address due to a technical error. The issue has been fixed. This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action. The impacted customers have been contacted.”
It added: “Amazon takes all security-related matters very seriously and your account security is our top priority. We have policies and security measures in place to ensure that your personal information remains secure.”
UK data regulator the Information Commissioner’s Office, which Amazon must inform of any data breach as part of the general data protection regulation (GDPR) introduced this year, said it was following the situation.
The timing of the breach could not have been worse for Amazon. While Black Friday predominantly takes place in the US around the Thanksgiving holiday, hundreds of UK retailers now also take part on what has become a multi-billion pound shopping day.
Richard Walters, chief technical officer of cybersecurity firm CensorNet, said those affected should ignore Amazons’s advice and consider changing their passwords.
“If the reports are correct, the information leaked – names and email addresses – is less significant than some of these other breaches, which saw card details leaked,” he said. “However, it would be wrong to assume that this makes the breach inconsequential. Cyber-criminals can do a lot of damage with a large database of names and emails.
“A large majority of people still use predictable passwords, and thanks to previous high-profile breaches many people’s passwords are also readily available on the dark web. For cyber-criminals, it then just becomes an exercise in joining the dots.

"277","Urban Massage","309,000","2018","Massage, a popular massage startup that bills itself as providing “wellness that comes to you,” has leaked its entire customer database.
The London, U.K.-based startup — now known as just Urban — left its Google-hosted ElasticSearch database online without a password, allowing anyone to read hundreds of thousands of customer and staff records. Anyone who knew where to look could access, edit or delete the database.
Security researcher Oliver Hough found the database through Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, and told TechCrunch of the exposure.
It’s not known how long the database was exposed or if anyone else had accessed or obtained the database before it was pulled. It’s believed that the database was exposed for at least a few weeks.
Urban pulled the database offline after TechCrunch reached out.
Chief executive Jack Tang said in a statement: “Urban is looking into this as a matter of utmost urgency. We have informed the ICO and will take all other appropriate action, including in relation to data and communications.”
A spokesperson for the ICO, the UK’s data protection regulator, confirmed it was aware of the breach and, “will assess the information we receive against data protection laws, before deciding whether or not to investigate.”
At the time of securing the database, the company had exposed more than 309,000 user records, including names, email addresses and phone numbers. Each record also had a unique referral code, allowing friends to get discounted treatments.
We verified the data by contacting several users at random. One user, who did not want to be named, said the data exposure was a “huge violation” of her privacy.
The database also contained over 351,000 booking records, and more than 2,000 records on Urban massage therapists, including their names, email addresses and phone numbers.
That roughly amounts to similar figures reported by the company earlier this month.
Among the records included thousands of complaints from workers about their clients. The records included specific complaints — from account blocks for fraudulent behavior, abuse of the referral system and persistent cancelers. But, many records also included allegations of sexual misconduct by clients — such as asking for “massage in genital area” and requesting “sexual services from therapist.” Others were marked as “dangerous,” while others were blocked due to “police enquiries.” Each complaint included a customer’s personally identifiable information — including their name, address and postcode and phone number.
But from a cursory review of the data, the database didn’t contain financial information — such as credit cards or individual account passwords.
How the data came to be exposed remains a mystery, but the severity of the data is serious — and the repercussions could be significant. Because the company falls under the new European-wide GDPR rules, Urban may face steep financial penalties of up to four percent of its global annual revenue.
For a company that’s centered around bringing relaxation to the masses, this breach will likely cause unnecessary stress for a lot of people.

According to web security site Have I Been Pwned, hackers were able to obtain email addresses, names, order histories, hashed passwords, and both physical and IP addresses for 411,000 High Tail Hall players.
The game features sexualized, anthropomorphic animals and allows users to have ‘erotic encounters’ with other characters.
Creators of the game say they are aware of the issue and have since moved to a ‘more advanced and stable security system,’ but are urging users to change their passwords as an added precaution.
Troy Hunt, who runs HIBP, spotted the breach and alerted HTH Studios.
While the breach itself took place back in August, Hunt says the data appeared on a popular hacking forum months later.
‘In August 2018, the adult furry interactive game creator HTH Studios suffered a data breach impacting multiple repositories of customer data,’ Hunt tweeted.
‘Several months later, the data surfaced on a popular hacking forum and included 411k unique email addresses along with physical and IP addresses, names, orders, salted SHA-1 and salted MD5 hashes. HTH Studios is aware of the incident.’
According to HTH Studios, the data was leaked from their old website; High Tail Hall switched over to a new, more secure system in October.
After being alerted by Hunt this week, however, HTH Studios says it has contacted ‘security, developers, legal counsel, and law enforcement’ to investigate the issue.
‘Both our internal security and web team security assures us that no financial data was compromised,’ an HTH admin said on the site.
The breach is just the latest in a string of attacks targeting adult websites over the last few years. 
Massive hacks hit Ashley Madison, xHamster, and Adult FriendFinder back in 2015 and 2016, and so-called ‘sextortion’ scams have been on the rise.
HTH Studios says it’s taking steps to ensure its users are protected, and says its new website is a ‘MUCH more advanced and stable security system.’
‘The security and comfort of our users is the highest priority,’ HTH_Crow said in the post.

"280","SKY Brasil","32,000,000","2018","Data belonging to 32 million customers of SKY Brasil has been exposed online long enough to make their theft very likely, an independent security researcher discovered.
Fábio Castro found that the data cache could be reached by anyone that knew where to look on the internet.
Personal info ready for the picking
Using the advanced features of the Shodan search engine, he was able to discover multiple servers in Brazil running Elasticsearch that made information available without authentication.
A cluster of servers called ""digital-logs-prd"" attracted the researcher's attention and with a simple command, he listed the indices available, one of them 429.1GB in size.
 
The file included personally identifiable information of SKY Brasil customers, which featured full name, email address, service login password, client IP address, payment methods, phone number, and street address.
""The data the server stored was Full name, e-mail, password, pay-TV package data (Sky Brazil), client ip addresses, personal addresses, payment methods,"" Castro told BleepingComputer. ""Among other information the model of the device, serial numbers of the device that is in the customer's home, and also the log files of the whole platform.""
SKY Brasil is a telecommunications company that also offers television services, being the second largest provider of pay-TV services in the country, according to statistics from March.
In a conversation with BleepingComputer, Castro said that he reported his findings to the company who fixed the problem by restricting access with a password, an operation that takes just a few minutes.
Because the server has been exposed for a long time, the protective measure may have come too late. Castro told us that it is very possible that criminals have already grabbed the data.
Bad habits die hard
According to the researcher, who is a customer of SKY Brasil and had his info exposed, too, the data cache contained the home addresses and phone numbers belonging to high-ranked politicians, such as governors, and government employees.
Details like these are a boon for criminals. They can use it in elaborate and difficult to detect social engineering attacks well-off individuals.
Although protecting sensitive information against public access is common sense security, misconfigured Elasticsearch servers are a regular thing even for large corporations handling hundreds of millions of records with personal data.
Cybercriminals have been taking advantage of data servers exposed online for a long time. BleepingComputer reported in the past on hackers hijacking insecure MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, CouchDB, Cassandra, and MySQL and holding them for ransom.

"281","Vision Direct","100,000","2018","Attackers have compromised Vision Direct customers’ contact information and financial details, including complete card numbers, expiry dates and the CVV security code.
The UK retailer specialising in contact lenses told a number of its customers this weekend that their details had been stolen in a data breach that lasted five days, between 3 and 8 November.
The attackers made away with personal information, such as full name, address, phone number, email address, and password, as well as customers’ financial details including the CVV security code required to complete online transactions.
""Unfortunately this information could be used to conduct fraudulent transactions,"" Vision Direct UK said in a letter to customers.
""Vision Direct has taken steps to prevent any further data theft, the website is working normally and we are working with the authorities to investigate how this theft occurred.""
Vision Direct did not say how many users may have been affected and did not offer an explanation at this early stage.
The company has asked users to review their bank statements as soon as possible and change their passwords on the website.
Questions also remain over whether the firm had been storing CVV codes against PCI standards, as it is not permitted to keep verification codes after payments are authorised.
But it is unclear whether the CVV codes stolen in this breach were previously stored, or intercepted as customers made transactions.
IT Pro asked the retailer how many users were affected, how exactly the attack occurred, and whether the CVV codes stolen were held or intercepted, but did not get a response at the time of writing.
Although there is no official explanation, security researcher Troy Mursch discovered that the attackers may have stolen the data by running a fake Google Analytics script on the UK website, as well as several domains across Europe.
Perhaps running against the consensus, CEO of web security firm High-Tech Bridge Ilia Kolochenko has branded this incident “much fuss about nothing”.
""Allegedly, the breach lasted for five days and impacted only a very limited, statistically negligent, number of customers,” he said. We have been seeing much worse data breaches occur on a daily basis.
""Similarly, the supposed method of data theft via a fake Google analytics script presumably inserted by developers’ mistake is not novel or otherwise remarkable. Instead it is just one more colourful example of when a human is the weakest link.""
""Strange that such a visible hack remained undetected by third parties for five consecutive days however.""
The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) told IT Pro it had not yet received any reports concerning the Vision Direct data breach.
""Organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach unless it does not pose a risk to people’s rights and freedoms,"" an ICO spokesperson said.
""If an organisation decides that a breach doesn’t need to be reported they should keep their own record of it, and be able to explain why it wasn’t reported if necessary.
""All organisations processing personal data should do so safely and securely. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled, they can report these concerns to us.""

The agency said that “anomalous system activity” was detected last week in the Direct Enrollment system, which Americans use to enroll in healthcare plans via the insurance exchange established under the Affordable Care Act—also known as Obamacare.
A breach was declared on Wednesday. It’s unclear why the agency, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, chose to not announce the incident sooner.
Officials said the hacked portal is used by insurance agents and brokers to help Americans sign up for coverage and that no other systems were involved. The affected system has been disabled. CMS said it hoped to restore it before the end of next week.
The accounts linked to the suspicious activity have also been deactivated.
“I want to make clear to the public that HealthCare.gov and the Marketplace Call Center are still available, and open enrollment will not be negatively impacted,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. “We are working to identify the individuals potentially impacted as quickly as possible so that we can notify them and provide resources such as credit protection.”
The agency did not supply any additional details regarding the types of personal information exposed, though insurance applicants are typically asked to provide sensitive details, such as Social Security numbers. A request for comment was not immediately answered.
“It is important to note that CMS is in the beginning stages of the assessment of this breach,” CMS said. “This is an evolving situation and we will continue to provide additional information.”

Since Oct. 16, when CMS detected “suspicious activity” in the Affordable Care Act-established Direct Enrollment Pathway for agents and brokers, the agency has notified all affected parties via mail and phone. The organization offered free credit protection and other preventive and remedial services related to identity monitoring, identity theft insurance and identity restoration, officials said this week.
At first, about a month ago, CMS said that “anomalous activity” in the system had compromised data from roughly 75,000 people. But after working with law enforcement officials, the entity reached the updated total that it released this week.
The precise nature of the security incident remains unclear. After several requests for more information from Healthcare Analytics News™, CMS press officials have declined to comment, citing the open investigation.
In its latest update, the agency didn’t offer any additional information regarding the suspicious activity. We are awaiting comment from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of the Inspector General, which is now handling media requests related to the incident.
About a week after the data breach, CMS sent out an alert claiming that the breach didn’t affect any protected health information or banking or federal tax data.
A letter sent to victims, however, noted that names, dates of birth, addresses, portions of Social Security numbers, expected income, family relationships, health insurance status and other information might have been compromised in the incident.
The cyberattack occurred shortly before open enrollment began on Nov. 1, raising unfounded concerns that registration infrastructure could be paralyzed. Although CMS closed the Direct Enrollment Pathway — a portal that allows agents and brokers to help consumers obtain health insurance — other avenues remained unimpeded. CMS also returned service to the Direct Enrollment Pathway prior to November.

Anonymous sources told the WSJ that the company does not believe a nation-state was involved.
The hacker stole personal information of 29 million Facebook users.
Facebook believes that spammers, and not a nation-state, are responsible for a devastating recent hack that stole the personal information of 29 million Facebook users, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.
The report, which cites anonymous sources, says that Facebook has “tentatively” concluded the hackers were spammers who were posing as a digital marketing company.
The hack, which Facebook first disclosed in September, is the largest breach suffered by the social network. The hackers were able to exploit vulnerabilities in Facebook’s code to get their hands on “access tokens” – essentially digital keys that give them full access to compromised users’ accounts – and then scraped users’ data.
Among the user data stolen by hackers were birthdates, phone numbers, search history and even recent locations the users had “checked in” at.
Facebook and other social media services have increasingly been targeted by malicious actors seeking to use the platforms to spread misinformation and wreak other havoc. Facebook has said it believes Russian operatives were behind a campaign to spread misinformation ahead of the 2016 US Presidential elections.
The fact that criminal spammers, presumably with commercial motives rather than a political agenda, are behind the recent hack is an unexpected development, though it’s unlikely to quell some of the mistrust the company has earned from a large segment of users.
Interestingly, Facebook noted in an update last week that the FBI had asked it not to publicly discuss “who may be behind this attack.”
A Facebook representative referred Business Insider to the company’s statement from a week ago when it disclosed certain details of the incident: “We are cooperating with the FBI on this matter. The FBI is actively investigating and have asked us not to discuss who may be behind this attack.”

The university said stored credit card details, travel information, medical records, police checks, workers’ compensation, vehicle registration numbers and some performance records have not been affected.
“We have no evidence that research work has been affected,” Schmidt said.
ANU is working closely with Australian government security agencies and industry security partners to investigate the attack further, he added.
Last July, Australia’s top-ranked university said it had spent several months fighting off a threat to its computer systems, with reports hackers were traced to China.
“Following the incident reported last year, we undertook a range of upgrades to our systems to better protect our data. Had it not been for those upgrades, we would not have detected this incident,” Schmidt said.
Cyber security expert Greg Austin from the University of New South Wales said universities in Australia are a prime target.
He characterised the scale of this attack in the middle to top end.
“It’s fair to say states, major powers with cyber espionage capabilities do target universities … because the elites of various countries attend those universities,” he told Guardian Australia.
The academic said some foreign students studying in Australia would be the sons and daughters of overseas power-brokers or future leaders themselves.
Austin said corporations under cyber attack often become quite disorientated by the experience and are unsure whether to double or triple their investment in cyber security.
“One can’t necessarily blame ANU in a sense, these sort of attacks, if they’re a sophisticated foreign government, they will get this sort of information that’s been stolen by hook or by crook,” he said.
The Australian Cyber Security Centre confirmed it is working with ANU to secure the networks, protect users and investigate the full extent of the compromise.
“This compromise is a salient reminder that the cyber threat is real and that the methods used by malicious actors are constantly evolving,” a spokesman said.
“Unfortunately, a malicious actor with sufficient capability, time and resources will almost always be able to compromise an internet-connected computer network,” the spokesman said.
Australian Signals Directorate advised that it does appear to be the work of a sophisticated actor.
The university has set up a hotline for staff and students concerned about the breach: 1800 275 268.

"290","Canva","139,000,000","2019","Canva, a Sydney-based startup that's behind the eponymous graphic design service, was hacked earlier today, ZDNet has learned.
Data for roughly 139 million users has been taken during the breach, according to the hacker, who tipped off ZDNet.
Responsible for the breach is a hacker going online as GnosticPlayers. The hacker is infamous. Since February this year, he/she/they has put up for sale on the dark web the data of 932 million users, which he stole from 44 companies from all over the world.
HACK TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING
Today, the hacker contacted ZDNet about his latest hack, involving Australian tech unicorn Canva, which he said he breached just hours before, earlier this morning.
""I download everything up to May 17,"" the hacker said. ""They detected my breach and closed their database server.""
Stolen data included details such as customer usernames, real names, email addresses, and city & country information, where available.
For 61 million users, password hashes were also present in the database. The passwords where hashed with the bcrypt algorithm, currently considered one of the most secure password-hashing algorithms around.
For other users, the stolen information included Google tokens, which users had used to sign up for the site without setting a password.
Of the total 139 million users, 78 million users had a Gmail address associated with their Canva account.
ZDNet requested a sample of the hacked data, so we could verify the hacker's claims. We received a sample with the data of 18,816 accounts, including the account details for some of the site's staff and admins.
We used this information to contact Canva users, who verified the validity of the data we received. We also contacted the site's administrators, informing them of the breach and requesting an official statement.
""Canva was today made aware of a security breach which enabled access to a number of usernames and email addresses,"" a Canva spokesperson told ZDNet via email.
""We securely store all of our passwords using the highest standards (individually salted and hashed with bcrypt) and have no evidence that any of our users' credentials have been compromised. As a safeguard, we are encouraging our community to change their passwords as a precaution,"" the company said.
""We will continue to communicate with our community as we learn more about the situation.""
ONE OF THE INTERNET'S BIGGEST SITES
Canva is one of Australia's biggest tech companies. Founded in 2012, the Canva website has become a favorite among regular users and large companies who often use it to build quick websites, design logos, or put together eye-catching marketing materials.
Since its launch, the site has shot up the Alexa website traffic rank, and has recently entered the Top 200, currently ranked at #170.
Three days ago, the company announced it raised $70 million in a Series-D funding round, and is now valued at a whopping $2.5 billion. Canva also recently acquired two of the world's biggest free stock content sites -- Pexels and Pixabay. Details of Pexels and Pixabay users were not included in the data stolen by the hacker.
With today's hack, GnosticPlayers has now stolen over one billion user credentials, a goal the hacker told ZDNet in previous interviews he was aiming for. If anyone's still keeping count, that's 1,071 billion credentials from 45 companies.

"291","First American Financial Corporation","885,000,000","2019","The Web site for Fortune 500 real estate title insurance giant First American Financial Corp. leaked hundreds of millions of documents related to mortgage deals going back to 2003, until notified this week by KrebsOnSecurity. The digitized records — including bank account numbers and statements, mortgage and tax records, Social Security numbers, wire transaction receipts, and drivers license images — were available without authentication to anyone with a Web browser.
Santa Ana, Calif.-based First American is a leading provider of title insurance and settlement services to the real estate and mortgage industries. It employs some 18,000 people and brought in more than $5.7 billion in 2018.
Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by a real estate developer in Washington state who said he’d had little luck getting a response from the company about what he found, which was that a portion of its Web site (firstam.com) was leaking tens if not hundreds of millions of records. He said anyone who knew the URL for a valid document at the Web site could view other documents just by modifying a single digit in the link.
And this would potentially include anyone who’s ever been sent a document link via email by First American.
KrebsOnSecurity confirmed the real estate developer’s findings, which indicate that First American’s Web site exposed approximately 885 million files, the earliest dating back more than 16 years. No authentication was required to read the documents.
Many of the exposed files are records of wire transactions with bank account numbers and other information from home or property buyers and sellers. Ben Shoval, the developer who notified KrebsOnSecurity about the data exposure, said that’s because First American is one of the most widely-used companies for real estate title insurance and for closing real estate deals — where both parties to the sale meet in a room and sign stacks of legal documents.
“Closing agencies are supposed to be the only neutral party that doesn’t represent someone else’s interest, and you’re required to have title insurance if you have any kind of mortgage,” Shoval said.
You give them all kinds of private information and you expect that to stay private.
“The title insurance agency collects all kinds of documents from both the buyer and seller, including Social Security numbers, drivers licenses, account statements, and even internal corporate documents if you’re a small business. You give them all kinds of private information and you expect that to stay private.”
Shoval shared a document link he’d been given by First American from a recent transaction, which referenced a record number that was nine digits long and dated April 2019. Modifying the document number in his link by numbers in either direction yielded other peoples’ records before or after the same date and time, indicating the document numbers may have been issued sequentially.
The earliest document number available on the site – 000000075 — referenced a real estate transaction from 2003. From there, the dates on the documents get closer to real time with each forward increment in the record number.
As of the morning of May 24, firstam.com was returning documents up to the present day (885,000,000+), including many PDFs and post-dated forms for upcoming real estate closings. By 2 p.m. ET Friday, the company had disabled the site that served the records. It’s not yet clear how long the site remained in its promiscuous state, but archive.org shows documents available from the site dating back to at least March 2017.
First American wouldn’t comment on the overall number of records potentially exposed via their site, or how long those records were publicly available. But a spokesperson for the company did share the following statement:
“First American has learned of a design defect in an application that made possible unauthorized access to customer data.  At First American, security, privacy and confidentiality are of the highest priority and we are committed to protecting our customers’ information. The company took immediate action to address the situation and shut down external access to the application. We are currently evaluating what effect, if any, this had on the security of customer information. We will have no further comment until our internal review is completed.”
I should emphasize that these documents were merely available from First American’s Web site; I do not have any information on whether this fact was known to fraudsters previously, nor do I have any information to suggest the documents were somehow mass-harvested (although a low-and-slow or distributed indexing of this data would not have been difficult for even a novice attacker).
Nevertheless, the information exposed by First American would be a virtual gold mine for phishers and scammers involved in so-called Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, which often impersonate real estate agents, closing agencies, title and escrow firms in a bid to trick property buyers into wiring funds to fraudsters. According to the FBI, BEC scams are the most costly form of cybercrime today.
Armed with a single link to a First American document, BEC scammers would have an endless supply of very convincing phishing templates to use. A database like this also would give fraudsters a constant feed of new information about upcoming real estate financial transactions — including the email addresses, names and phone numbers of the closing agents and buyers.
As noted in past stories here, these types of data exposures are some of the most common yet preventable. In December 2018, the parent company of Kay Jewelers and Jared Jewelers fixed a weakness in their site that exposed the order information for all of their online customers.
In August 2018, financial industry giant Fiserv Inc. fixed a bug reported by KrebsOnSecurity that exposed personal and financial details of countless customers across hundreds of bank Web sites.
In July 2018, identity theft protection service LifeLock corrected an information disclosure flaw that exposed the email address of millions of subscribers. And in April 2018, PaneraBread.com remedied a weakness exposing millions of customer names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and partial credit card numbers.

"292","Chtrbox","49,000,000","2019","A massive database containing contact information of millions of Instagram  influencers, celebrities and brand accounts has been found online.
The database, hosted by Amazon Web Services, was left exposed and without a password allowing anyone to look inside. At the time of writing, the database had over 49 million records — but was growing by the hour.
From a brief review of the data, each record contained public data scraped from influencer Instagram accounts, including their bio, profile picture, the number of followers they have, if they’re verified and their location by city and country, but also contained their personal contact information, such as the Instagram account owner’s email address and phone number.
Security researcher Anurag Sen discovered the database and alerted TechCrunch in an effort to find the owner and get the database secured. We traced the database back to Mumbai-based social media marketing firm Chtrbox, which pays influencers to post sponsored content on their accounts. The records contained data that calculated the worth of each account, based off the number of followers, engagement, reach, likes and shares they had. This was used as a metric to determine how much the company could pay an Instagram celebrity or influencer to post an ad.
TechCrunch found several high-profile influencers in the exposed database, including prominent food bloggers, celebrities and other social media influencers.
We contacted several people at random whose information was found in the database and provided them their phone numbers. Two of the people responded and confirmed their email address and phone number found in the database was used to set up their Instagram accounts. Neither had any involvement with Chtrbox, they said.
Shortly after we reached out, Chtrbox pulled the database offline. Pranay Swarup, the company’s founder and chief executive, did not respond to a request for comment and several questions, including how the company obtained personal Instagram account email addresses and phone numbers. Later in a tweet, Chtrbox disputed the number of people affected and claimed no more than 350,000 influencers were affected. Chtrbox also said database was only open for 72 hours, but the researcher confirmed the database was first detected on Shodan, a search engine for exposed databases and devices, on May 14.
The scraping effort comes two years after Instagram admitted a security bug in its developer API allowed hackers to obtain the email addresses and phone numbers of six million Instagram accounts. The hackers later sold the data for bitcoin.
Months later, Instagram — now with more than a billion users — choked its API to limit the number of requests apps and developers can make on the platform.
Facebook, which owns Instagram, later said it disputed the report.
“We take any allegation of data misuse seriously. Following an initial investigation into the claims made in this story, we found that no private emails or phone numbers of Instagram users were accessed,” said an Instagram spokesperson. “Chtrbox’s database had publicly available information from many sources, one of which was Instagram. Chtrbox also clarified that the database contained information for 350,000 people, not 49 million as has been reported,”
“We’re looking into the issue to understand if the data described – including email and phone numbers – was from Instagram or from other sources,” said an updated statement. “We’re also inquiring with Chtrbox to understand where this data came from and how it became publicly available,” it added.

"293","WiFi Finder","2,000,000","2019","A popular hotspot finder app for Android exposed the Wi-Fi network passwords for more than two million networks.
The app, downloaded by thousands of users, allowed anyone to search for Wi-Fi networks in their nearby area. The app allows the user to upload Wi-Fi network passwords from their devices to its database for others to use.
That database of more than two million network passwords, however, was left exposed and unprotected, allowing anyone to access and download the contents in bulk.
Sanyam Jain, a security researcher and a member of the GDI Foundation, found the database and reported the findings to TechCrunch.
We spent more than two weeks trying to contact the developer, believed to be based in China, to no avail. Eventually we contacted the host, DigitalOcean,  which took down the database within a day of reaching out.
“We notified the user and have taken the [server] hosting the exposed database offline,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.
Each record contained the Wi-Fi network name, its precise geolocation, its basic service set identifier (BSSID) and network password stored in plaintext.
Although the app developer claims the app only provides passwords for public hotspots, a review of the data showed countless home Wi-Fi networks. The exposed data didn’t include contact information for any of the Wi-Fi network owners, but the geolocation of each Wi-Fi network correlated on a map often included networks in wholly residential areas or where no discernible businesses exist.
The app doesn’t require users to obtain the permission from the network owner, exposing Wi-Fi networks to unauthorized access. With access to a network, an attacker may be able to modify router settings to point unsuspecting users to malicious websites by changing the DNS server, a vital system used to convert web addresses into the IP addresses used to locate web servers on the internet. When on a network, an attacker also can read the unencrypted traffic that goes across the wireless network, allowing them to steal passwords and secrets.
Tens of thousands of the exposed Wi-Fi passwords are for networks based in the U.S.

"294","Toyota","3,100,000","2019","The personal information of roughly 3.1 million Toyota customers may have been leaked following a security breach of multiple Toyota and Lexus sales subsidiaries, as detailed in a breach notification issued by the car maker today.
As detailed in a press release published on Toyota'a global newsroom, unauthorized access was detected on the computing systems of Tokyo Sales Holdings, Tokyo Tokyo Motor, Tokyo Toyopet, Toyota Tokyo Corolla, Nets Toyota Tokyo, Lexus Koishikawa Sales, Jamil Shoji (Lexus Nerima), and Toyota West Tokyo Corolla.
""It turned out that up to 3.1 million items of customer information may have been leaked outside the company. The information that may have been leaked this time does not include information on credit cards,"" says the data breach notification.
Toyota has not yet confirmed if the attackers were able to exfiltrate any of the customer personal information exposed after the IT systems of its subsidiaries were breached. 
We have not confirmed the fact that customer information has been leaked at this time, but we will continue to conduct detailed surveys, placing top priority on customer safety and security.
""We apologize to everyone who has been using Toyota and Lexus vehicles for the great concern,"" states Toyota's notification.
Also, ""We take this situation seriously, and will thoroughly implement information security measures at dealers and the entire Toyota Group.""
This breach comes after Australian Toyota dealers were also targeted by a cyber attack which led to multiple corporate IT systems going down on February 19.
In a statement published two days after the incident that impacted Toyota's Australian dealers, a car maker spokesperson said that:
Our network of 279 dealers is still operational and able to help customers with their enquiries. However, there have been some impacts to parts supply, which is subsequently delaying servicing at some dealerships.
Security experts consider the attacks targeting Toyota's subsidiaries and dealers to be part of a large scale coordinated operation attributed to the Vietnamese-backed APT32 hacking group, also known as OceanLotus and Cobalt Kitty, says ZDNet.
FireEye says that APT32 is targeting ""foreign companies investing in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, consulting and hospitality sectors.""
APT32 also targeted research institutes from around the world, media organizations, various human rights organizations, and even Chinese maritime construction firms in the past.

"295","BreedReady","1,800,000","2019","An open database in China contains the personal information of more than 1.8 million women, including their phone numbers, addresses, and something called “BreedReady” status, according to a researcher.
Victor Gevers, a Dutch internet expert from the non-profit group GDI.Foundation, found the insecure data cache while searching for open databases in China. He posted a series of screenshots of it over the weekend.
The database, whose server is in China, included fields labeled in English for sex, age, education, marital status, as well as a column titled “BreedReady”, which could be a poor translation of Chinese terms to describe whether a woman has children or is of child-bearing age, observers noted. It was taken down late on Monday afternoon local time, according to Gevers.
The data breach is alarming in the context of official concerns over China’s falling birthrates. Women rights advocates and critics of China’s use of strict family planning rules worry about how far the government will go to encourage more women to have children.
It is not clear whether the database is related to a dating app, a government registry, or another organisation or company. Gevers, who also identified a database maintained by a surveillance company tracking at least 2.5 million residents in Xinjiang, said he was still taking samples and working on verifying the data.
“More than this, we don’t have at the moment. Our primary concern is that it gets secured ASAP,” he told the Guardian.
The average age of women in the database was 32, with the youngest being 15, he said. Almost 90% of included entries were described single and 82% were listed as living in Beijing.
The database also included fields labeled “political” and “hasvideo” as well as links to what appear to be Facebook profile pages. Facebook is blocked in China and can only be accessed through virtual private networks.
Other IT specialists believed the database could have been built by a hacker who stole secured data from a dating website. Gevers said he and others were contacting some of those whose profile pages were linked to see if they were aware of the database or had registered such information.
In a thread titled “Is this the prologue to The Handmaid’s Tale?” on the discussion forum Douban, Chinese internet users likened the database to the television show based on a future where women are forced to reproduce.
 
“This kind of database is very indicative and frightening,” said one user, adding: “I’m a pessimist and the fact that stories like The Handmaid’s Tale exist means the signs are already there.”
 
Others were less surprised and wondered whether the information could be related to the Chinese dating website Jiayuan, which was hacked by a security researcher aiming to highlight the site’s vulnerabilities in 2015. One user on Douban wrote: “To tell the truth, this kind of data is everywhere.”

"316","Petflow","1,000,000","2019","A hacker who stole close to 620 million user records from 16 websites has stolen another 127 million records from eight more websites, TechCrunch has learned.
The hacker, whose listing was the previously disclosed data for about $20,000 in bitcoin on a dark web marketplace, stole the data last year from several major sites — some that had already been disclosed, like more than 151 million records from MyFitnessPal and 25 million records from Animoto. But several other hacked sites on the marketplace listing didn’t know or hadn’t disclosed yet — such as 500px and Coffee Meets Bagel.
The Register, which first reported the story, said the data included names, email addresses and scrambled passwords, and in some cases other login and account data — though no financial data was included.
Now the same hacker has eight additional marketplace entries after their original listings were pulled offline, including:
According to the hacker’s listings, Ixigo and PetFlow  used the old and outdated MD5 hashing algorithm to scramble passwords, which these days is easy to unscramble. YouNow doesn’t store passwords, a spokesperson said.
In all, the hacker is selling the hacked data for about $14,500 in bitcoin.
Ariel Ainhoren, research team leader at Israeli security firm IntSights, said that the hacker may have used the same security flaw to target vulnerable sites.
Six of the 16 databases were running the same back-end PostgreSQL database software, said Ainhoren in an email to TechCrunch. In successfully exploiting the bug, the hacker was able to “dump” the database to a file and download it.
“We’re still analyzing it, but it could have been that he used some kind of vulnerability that surfaced around that time and wasn’t patched by these companies or a totally new unknown vulnerability,” he said. “As most of these sites were not known breaches, it seems we’re dealing here with a hacker that did the hacks by himself, and not just someone who obtained it from somewhere else and now just resold it.”
When reached, Jonathan Katz, a contributor for PostgreSQL, said the open-source project was “currently unaware of any patched or unpatched vulnerabilities that could have caused these breaches.”
“There are many factors that need to be taken into consideration when securing a database system that go beyond the database software. We have often found that data breaches into a PostgreSQL database involve an indirect attack vector, such as a flaw in an application accessing PostgreSQL or a suboptimal policy around data management,” he said. “When it comes to vulnerabilities, the PostgreSQL community has a dedicated security team that evaluates and fixes issues and, in the spirit of open source collaboration, transparently reports on and educates our users about them.”

In an email sent out to users and an announcement posted to its website, 500px states that it was only on February 8th, 2019, that its team learned of an unauthorized intrusion to its system that occurred on or around July 5th, 2018.
The personal data that may have been stolen by the intruder includes first and last names, usernames, email addresses, password hashes (i.e. not plaintext passwords), location (i.e. city, state, country), birth date, and gender.
“At this time, there is no indication of unauthorized access to your account, and no evidence that other data associated with your user profile was affected, such as credit card information (which is not stored on our servers), if used to make any purchases, or any other sensitive personal information,” 500px says.

"318","Blur","2,400,000","2019","Abine, the company behind the Blur password manager and the DeleteMe online privacy protection service, revealed on Monday a data breach impacting nearly 2.4 million Blur users, ZDNet has learned.
The breach came to light last year, on December 13, when a security researcher contacted the company about a server that exposed a file containing sensitive information about Blur users, an Abine spokesperson told ZDNet via email.
The company said it followed this initial report with an internal security audit to determine the size of the breach. The audit concluded last week, and the company made the data leak public on Monday in a post on its blog.
According to Abine, the file that was left freely accessible online contained various details about Blur users who registered before January 6, 2018. Exposed information included:
Each user's email addresses
Some users' first and last names
Some users' password hints but only from our old MaskMe product
Each user's last and second-to-last IP addresses used to login to Blur
Each user's encrypted Blur password. These encrypted passwords are encrypted and hashed before they are transmitted to our servers, and they are then encrypted using bcrypt with a unique salt for every user. The output of this encryption process for these users was potentially exposed, not actual user passwords.
The company stressed that no passwords stored inside users' Blur accounts were exposed.
""We do not have access to your most critical unencrypted data, including the usernames and passwords for your stored accounts, your autofill credit cards, and so on. As frustrated as we are right now, we are glad that we have taken that approach,"" said Abine.
""There is no evidence that the usernames and passwords stored by our users in Blur, auto-fill credit card details, Masked Emails, Masked Phone numbers, and Masked Credit Card numbers were exposed. There is no evidence that user payment information was exposed,"" the company added.
No data was exposed from the company's DeleteMe service.
Abine is now urging users to change their Blur master password and enable two-factor authentication for their account.
""As a privacy and security focused company this incident is embarrassing and frustrating,"" Abine said. ""These incidents should not happen and we let our users down.""

"320","Indian Jobseekers","275,265,298","2019","A huge MongoDB database exposing 275,265,298 records of Indian citizens containing detailed personally identifiable information (PII) was left unprotected on the Internet for more than two weeks.
Security Discovery researcher Bob Diachenko discovered the publicly accessible MongoDB database hosted on Amazon AWS using Shodan, and as historical data provided by the platform showed, the huge cache of PII data was first indexed on April 23, 2019.
As he found out after further investigation, the exposed data included information such as name, gender, date of birth, email, mobile phone number, education details, professional info (employer, employment history, skills, functional area), and current salary for each of the database records.
While the unprotected MongoDB database leaked the sensitive information of hundreds of millions of Indians, Diachenko did not find any information that would link it to a specific owner.
Additionally, the names of the data collections stored within the database suggested that the entire cache of resumes was collected ""as part of a massive scraping operation"" for unknown purposes.
The researcher ""immediately notified Indian CERT team on the incident, however, database remained open and searchable until today, May 8th, when it got dropped by hackers known as ‘Unistellar’ group.""
After the database got dropped by the hackers, Diachenko discovered the following message left behind after deleting all the data: 
Diachenko found multiple other unsecured databases and servers, unearthing a publicly accessible 140+ GB MongoDB database containing a huge collection of 808,539,939 email records during Early-March and another one with over 200 million records with resumes from Chinese job seekers in January.
He was also the one who discovered the personal information of more than 66 million individuals left out in the open on the Internet during December and an extra 11 million records during September, with all of them being stored in misconfigured and passwordless MongoDB instances.
These data leaks are a thing because a lot of MongoDB databases are left publicly accessible by their owners and are not properly secured. This means that they can be blocked by securing the database instance.
MongoDB provides a Security section on the Documentation website which shows how to properly secure a MongoDB database, as well as a security checklist for MongoDB administrators.

"321","Bulgarian National Revenue Agency","5,000,000","2019","A mysterious hacker has stolen the personal details of millions of Bulgarians and has emailed download links to the stolen data to local news publications.
The data's origin is believed to be the country's National Revenue Agency (NRA), a department of the Bulgarian Ministry of Finance.
In a message posted on its website on Monday, the NRA said it was working with the Ministry of the Interior and the State Agency for National Security (SANS) to investigate the hack.
""We are currently verifying whether the data is real,"" said the NRA.
Hours after this article's publication, the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior confirmed the hack.
HACKER STOLE 110 DATABASES, LEAKED 57
According to reports from local media, who received part of the data, the hacker said they stole the personal details of over five million Bulgarians, of the country's total population of seven million.
The hacker bragged about stealing 110 databases from NRA's network, totaling nearly 21 GB. The hacker only shared 57 databases, comprising 11 GB of the aggregate data with local news outlets but promised to release the rest in the coming days.
The leak contains names, personal identification numbers (PINs), home addresses, and financial earnings. Most of the information is years old, dating back as far as 2007, but newer database entries were also discovered.
Besides NRA-specific information, there is also other info which appears to have been imported into NRA systems from other government agencies.
The leaked data also contained information from Department Civil Registration and Administrative Services (GRAO), a database the department described similar to ""the Social Security Number (or similar) identification in other countries.""
Information was also found that belonged to Bulgaria's customs agency, namely data from the Bulgarian Excise Centralized Information System (BECIS), a database for storing information about excise taxes for imported goods.
In addition, there was also some information that local media deemed to have belonged to the National Health Insurance Fund (NZOK), although they have not detailed the precise nature of the information, and data from the Bulgarian Employment Agency (AZ).
HACKER IS AN ASSANGE FAN
The hacker contacted local media from a Yandex.ru email address and included a variation of a quote from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, which roughly translates from Bulgarian to ""Your government is stupid. Your cybersecurity is a parody.""
In an interview with a Bulgarian TV station, the hacker claimed he was a Russian man married to a Bulgarian woman, although, these statements should not be taken at face value. He also claimed to have had access to the NRA's network for more than 11 years.
Opposition parties in Bulgaria have not wasted any time. Within hours of the leak going public, the Democratic Bulgaria party demanded the resignation of Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov.
Last month, Bulgarian authorities arrested and temporarily held a Bulgarian IT expert for releasing public details about how to exploit a vulnerability in a state-managed kindergarten web portal to harvest the GRAO details of all Bulgarians. The two incidents don't appear to be related.

"322","Capital One","100,000,000","2019","Topline: Capital One said Monday that sensitive financial information—including social security and bank account numbers—from over 100 million people were exposed in a massive data breach that led to the arrest of former Amazon employee Paige Thompson, a hacker who lives in Seattle.
The information was taken from credit card applications submitted to the Virginia-based bank from 2005 to 2019. These included names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth and self-reported income. 
Additionally, Capital One said that 140,000 Social Security and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised as well as fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016, 2017 and 2018.
No credit card account numbers or log-in credentials were exposed.
Individuals whose information was compromised in the breach will be notified by Capital One.
PROMOTED
Federal agents have arrested a Seattle woman named Paige Thompson for hacking into cloud computing servers rented by Capital One, according to court documents. Investigators say Thompson previously worked at the cloud computing company whose servers were breached, but did not name the company.
Thompson’s résumé, which is still online, and her LinkedIn profile indicate that she worked at Amazon, which operates the popular cloud computing business Amazon Web Services, from 2015 to 2016. 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes.
Using the online alias “erratic,” Thompson allegedly talked about the files she accessed in a Slack group and in a direct message on Twitter, the court documents say.
“Ive basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, f*cking dropping capital ones dox and admitting it. I wanna distribute those buckets I think first. There are ssns… with full names and dob,” a Twitter direct message sent from Thompson reads. A screenshot of the message was included in the court documents. 
Thompson allegedly posted the information from the hack on her Github profile, which included a link to her résumé, leading the FBI to her. Github is an online service that allows users to upload and store code. 
Forbes was unable to reach Thompson for comment.
 
The hack occurred on March 22 or 23, the court documents say, but no one at Capital One knew the bank had been breached until four months later when an anonymous security researcher alerted them.

The Israeli security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar working with vpnmentor, a service that reviews virtual private network services, have been running a side project to scans ports looking for familiar IP blocks, and then use these blocks to find holes in companies’ systems that could potentially lead to data breaches.
In a search last week, the researchers found Biostar 2’s database was unprotected and mostly unencrypted. They were able to search the database by manipulating the URL search criteria in Elasticsearch to gain access to data.
The researchers had access to over 27.8m records, and 23 gigabytes-worth of data including admin panels, dashboards, fingerprint data, facial recognition data, face photos of users, unencrypted usernames and passwords, logs of facility access, security levels and clearance, and personal details of staff.
Much of the usernames and passwords were not encrypted, Rotem told the Guardian.
“We were able to find plain-text passwords of administrator accounts,” he said.
“The access allows first of all seeing millions of users are using this system to access different locations and see in real time which user enters which facility or which room in each facility, even.”
“We [were] able to change data and add new users,” he said.
This would mean that he could edit an existing user’s account and add his own fingerprint and then be able to access whatever building that user is authorised to access, or he could just add himself as a user with his photo and fingerprints.
In the paper about the discovery provided to the Guardian before being published by vpnmentor on Wednesday, the researchers said they were able to access data from co-working organisations in the US and Indonesia, a gym chain in India and Sri Lanka, a medicine supplier in the United Kingdom, and a car parking space developer in Finland, among others.
The researchers said the sheer scale of the breach was alarming because the service is in 1.5m locations across the world and because, unlike passwords being leaked, when fingerprints are leaked, you can’t change your fingerprint.
“Instead of saving a hash of the fingerprint (that can’t be reverse-engineered) they are saving people’s actual fingerprints that can be copied for malicious purposes,” the researchers said in the paper.
The researchers made multiple attempts to contact Suprema before taking the paper to the Guardian late last week. Early Wednesday morning (Australian time) the vulnerability was closed, but they still have not heard back from the security firm.
 
Chinese cyberhackers 'blurring line between state power and crime'
Suprema’s head of marketing, Andy Ahn, told the Guardian the company had taken an “in-depth evaluation” of the information provided by vpnmentor and would inform customers if there was a threat.
“If there has been any definite threat on our products and/or services, we will take immediate actions and make appropriate announcements to protect our customers’ valuable businesses and assets,” Ahn said.
Rotem said the problem wasn’t unique to Suprema.
“It’s very common. There’s literally millions of open systems, and going through them is a very tedious process,” he said. “And some of the systems are quite sensitive.”
He said supply chain vulnerabilities – where a company uses a third-party company for a service that doesn’t have appropriate security – was common but often some of the vulnerabilities discovered were with Fortune 500 companies.
Rotem said he contacts around three or four companies per week with similar issues. Earlier this year, Rotem pointed out a substantial flaw in Amadeus’s flight booking system.
“Mistakes happen, and the real test is how you handle them,” Rotem said. “If you have a security team that can respond quickly and efficiently it’s good enough. If you have a security team that will send a legal team to threaten you, well, it’s less efficient.
“And this happens quite a lot. It’s unpleasant for someone to point out you have a vulnerability or weakness. Some people take it as an opportunity to fix it and some people are offended by it for some reason.”

"324","Facebook","419,000,000","2019","In a devastating blow to almost 20% of Facebook’s 2.3 billion users, several unprotected databases were discovered online that contain 419 million records of Facebook users, reports TechCrunch. The databases were found on a server and had no password protections in place, which meant they were freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

Among the databases were records of 133 million U.S.-based Facebook users, 18 million U.K.-based users, and one with 50 million records on users in Vietnam. Each record in the databases contains a Facebook user’s unique ID and the phone number listed on the account. Some of the records also contain the user’s name, gender, and country location.

It’s important to note that Facebook itself has not been hacked. Rather, the databases contained scraped information about Facebook users when Facebook still allowed developers access to user’s phone numbers, which it revoked in 2018.

It’s unknown who owned the databases, though they have been pulled from the server they were contained on after the web hosting company was notified of their existence. When TechCrunch reached out to Facebook for comment on the discovered databases, Facebook said:

This data set is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people’s ability to find others using their phone numbers. The data set has been taken down and we have seen no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised.

Still, the massive leak of 419 million Facebook users’ phone numbers presents an incredible security risk for those users. SIM-hacking is becoming a more common way of targeting users for identity theft, and all a bad actor needs is a person’s phone number and some basic information that could be gleaned from social engineering. Additionally, the leaked phone numbers also expose 419 million people to potentially more spam phone calls.","tech","2",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Web_Based_Attack"
"325","UCLA Health","4,500,000","2015","March 21, 2019 - UCLA Health reached a class-action lawsuit settlement with the 4.5 million current and former patients impacted by its May 2015 health data breach.
The settlement will provide $2 million for unreimbursed loss and preventative measures claims. The remaining $5.5 million will provide a cybersecurity enhancement fund, agreed to by UCLA Health.
The plaintiffs are patients whose personal information was exposed in a hack on the California health system’s network. Officials discovered suspicious activity on the network in October 2014, but at the time it did not appear as if the hackers had gained access to systems containing personal and medical data.
In May 2015, officials said the cyberattack was confirmed to have impacted those systems with patient information, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, Medicaid or health plan identification numbers, and some medical data.
As a result, the impacted patients launched a class-action lawsuit in July 2015. The plaintiffs argued UCLA Health was negligent in its security efforts to protect patient data, which put patients at risk of identity theft.
They claimed the health system failed to report the breach in a timely fashion. Under HIPAA, providers are required to notify patients within 60-days upon breach discovery. Further, they argued the health system should have foreseen the potential for a cyberattack given the prevalence of other security incidents among other “big players” in the health sector.
At the time, the health system faced other accusations of invasion of privacy, breach of contract, negligence, and a violation of several California privacy laws.
Under the settlement, UCLA Health agreed to a number of resolutions. To start, all class action members can sign up for free identity protection services, which will provide two years of coverage.
The health system also agreed to reimburse patients for expenses incurred in their attempts to protect themselves against identity theft, or losses suffered from identity theft and or fraud. In total, patients can receive up to $5,000 for preventive costs and up to $20,000 in losses or damages.
UCLA Health also agreed to update its cybersecurity practices and policies. Patients who wish to claim or object to the settlement must do so by May 20, 2019. Those who need to submit a claim for preventive measures or unreimbursed losses have until June 18, 2019.

"326","DoorDash","4,900,000","2019","The food delivery company said in a blog post Thursday that 4.9 million customers, delivery workers and merchants had their information stolen by hackers.
The breach happened on May 4, the company said, but added that customers who joined after April 5, 2018 are not affected by the breach.
It’s not clear why it took almost five months for DoorDash to detect the breach.
DoorDash spokesperson Mattie Magdovitz blamed the breach on “a third-party service provider,” but the third-party was not named. “We immediately launched an investigation and outside security experts were engaged to assess what occurred,” she said.
Users who joined the platform before April 5, 2018 had their name, email and delivery addresses, order history, phone numbers and hashed and salted passwords stolen.
The company also said consumers had the last four digits of their payment cards taken, though full numbers and card verification values (CVV) were not taken. Both delivery workers and merchants had the last four digits of their bank account numbers stolen.
Around 100,000 delivery workers also had their driver’s license information stolen in the breach.
The news comes almost exactly a year after DoorDash customers complained that their accounts had been hacked. The company at the time denied a data breach and claimed attackers were running credential stuffing attacks, in which hackers take lists of stolen usernames and passwords and try them on other sites that use the same passwords. But many of the customers we spoke to said their passwords were unique to DoorDash, ruling out such an attack.
When asked at the time, DoorDash could not explain how the affected accounts were breached.

"327","BriansClub","26,000,000","2019","A thriving online bazaar selling stolen payment card data has been hacked in a heist that leaked the records for more than 26 million cards, KrebsOnSecurity reported on Tuesday.
The 26 million figure isn't significant only to the legitimate consumers and businesses who own the stolen cards or the financial institutions that issued them. Fortunately for the card owners, the database is now in the hands of affected financial institutions, who can invalidate and replace the cards.
The number, therefore, is perhaps a bigger deal because it represents a significant fraction of the world's stolen-card inventory. Krebs said that Gemini Advisory, a company that monitors dozens of underground markets trafficking stolen card data, currently tracks a total of 87 million credit and debit card records. The haul of 26 million cards means that about a third of that supply has been taken out of circulation in a single swipe.
""With over 78% of the illicit trade of stolen cards attributed to only a dozen Dark Web markets, a breach of this magnitude will undoubtedly disturb the underground trade in the short term,"" Gemini co-founder and CEO Andrei Barysevich told Krebs. ""However, since the demand for stolen credit cards is on the rise, other vendors will undoubtedly attempt to capitalize on the disappearance of the top player.""
BriansClub
The hacked market is called BriansClub, a site available at BriansClub[.]at that, for years, has imitated Krebs' site and likeness. The data taken in the hack shows that BriansClub acquired 1.7 million cards in 2015, 2.9 million in 2016, 4.9 million in 2017, 9.2 million in 2018, and 7.6 million in the first eight months of this year. Most of the pilfered data is composed of ""dumps,"" the term card thieves use to describe data that's stored on the magnetic stripe of payment cards. The stolen dumps can be transferred to new cards that crooks use to buy electronics, gift cards, and other large-ticket items from big-box stores. An analysis based on how many of the cards had expiration dates in the future suggests that more than 14 million of the leaked records could still be valid.
Based on the pricing tiers listed on BriansClub, the haul represents about $414 million worth of lost sales, security intelligence firm Flashpoint told Krebs. By tracking the cards that were once available for sale and later removed, Flashpoint estimated that BriansClub has sold data for about 9.1 million cards for about $126 million. Federal prosecutors often value each stolen credit card record at $500, a sum that represents the average cost incurred from each compromised holder. Based on that estimate, the 9.1 million cards translates to about $2.27 billion in losses.
